Create a fully functional Express app using ESM modules.

:::caution

This template is in its alpha stage and will be evolving rapidly with new
features and updates. Changes may include directory structures, Express app
patterns, and more. We are also planning to support:

-   TypeScript
-   React
-   Modes (production, playground, etc.)
-   Databases (Mongo, SQL, etc.)
-   And
    [more...](https://github.com/users/marcellino-ornelas/projects/2/views/5?pane=issue&itemId=59501342)

We welcome your feedback! Feel free to share ideas for tools or frameworks you'd
like to see supported, or any thoughts you have on the structure of the Express
app and the libraries we use.

<Button

        if (typeof gtag === 'function') {
            gtag('event', 'feedback_request_click', {
                event_category: 'Feedback',
                event_label: 'express-app',

to use this template.

## Installation

This templates is a part of Templates library. If you've already installed
Templates, you'll have instant access to this template, and you can disregard
this command.

```bash
npm i -g templates-mo
```

## Options

<TemplateOptions template="express-app" type="js" />

## Copy

It allows you to duplicate the template into your project and tailor it to your
needs.

```bash
# if your not initialized run
tps init

# copy template
tps copy express-app
```

## Examples

### How to use

This template generates a fully functional Express app. The name you provide to
the CLI will be used for both the app's directory and the `package.json` name.
To create the app in a specific directory, prepend the directory path to the
name.

**Example:**

If you're building a new Express app for a restaurant called `chickens-burgers`,
you would run the following command:

```bash
tps express-app chickens-burgers

# if you want this directory in say a directory called projects, then run the following command
tps express-app ./project/chickens-burgers
```

This will create a new directory called `chickens-burgers`, set up all the
necessary files and directories for your Express app, and install the required
packages using your preferred package manager.

```txt
|- funny-gifs/
    | node_modules/
        | - all libraries node modules...
    | - src
        | - config/
            | - constrants.js
        | - middlewares/
            | - error-handler.js
        | - routes
            | - index.js
        | app.js
    | - .env
    | - package.json
    | - package-lock.json
```

Once your template is created, you can cd into the directory and run the
following command to start the app:

```bash
npm run start

# dev mode with nodemon
npm run dev
```

### Typescript

Use the `typescript` option to create a express app in typescript. This option
will change all `js` extensions to `ts`, add a `tsconfig.json` file, add some
types to various areas of the codebase, and modify the `package.json` to support
typescript.

**Example:**

If you're building a new Express app for a restaurant called `chickens-burgers`,
you would run the following command:

```bash
tps express-app chickens-burgers --typescript

# if you want this directory in say a directory called projects, then run the following command
tps express-app ./project/chickens-burgers --typescript
```

This will create a new directory called `chickens-burgers`, set up all the
necessary files and directories for your Express app, and install the required
packages using your preferred package manager.

```txt
|- funny-gifs/
    | node_modules/
        | - all libraries node modules...
    | - src
        | - config/
            | - constrants.ts
        | - middlewares/
            | - error-handler.ts
        | - routes
            | - index.ts
        | app.ts
    | - .env
    | - package.json
    | - package-lock.json
    | - tsconfig.json
```

Once your template is created, you can `cd` into the directory and run the
following command to start the app:

```bash
npm run build && npm run start

# Dev mode with nodemon
npm run dev

# Use serve if you want to run with ts-node
npm run serve
```
