### Configure your react component

Tired of typing in your same responses every time? Initialize your repo with
templates and you can configure the template to fit your projects needs without
having to answer every prompt.

If you havent already initialize your repo:

```bash
tps init
```

lets say your project always uses a `tsx` extention for its components. You can
add `tsx` to the `extension` answer.

```json title=".tps/.tpsrc"
{
  "react-component": {
    "answers": {
      "extension": "tsx"
    }
  }
}
```

Now templates will no longer prompt you for this question and always create your
component with a `tsx` extension.
