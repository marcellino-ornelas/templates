	| - Nav.js
	| - Nav.css
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="long build path">

```bash
tps react-component src/components/Nav
```

Produces:

```txt

## Installation

This templates is a part of Templates library. If you've already installed
Templates, you'll have instant access to this template, and you can disregard
this command.

```bash

## Examples

### How to use

Lets say you have a basic react folder structure like so:

```text
| - <cwd>/
	| - src/
		| - components/
			| - ...
		| - pages/
			| - ...
		| - index.js
		| - app.js
	| - package.json
	| - package-lock.json
```

If you wanted to generate a new component called `Nav` in the components folder,
you could use the following command:

```bash
> tps react-component src/components/Nav
```

You will be prompted to answer the following questions:

```
? Would you like to use typescript?
? What type of extension do you want for your component?
? Would you like to include a css file?
? What type of css extension would you like?
? Would you like to include unit tests?
? Would you like to include a index file?
? Would you like to include a storybook file?
```

Depending on the answers you provide it will generate something similar to the
following:

```txt
| - <cwd>/
	| - src/
		| - components/
			// highlight-start
			| - Nav/
				| - index.js
				| - Nav.js
				| - Nav.css
			// highlight-end
			| - ...
		| - pages/
			| - ...
		| - index.js
		| - app.js
	| - package.json
	| - package-lock.json
```

### How to use options

The React component template offers various customization options, which are
listed in the [options](#options) table. These will be prompted to you when you
create a new instance. However to save time and avoid answering the same
questions each time, you can set your answers ahead of time. You can do this
either on the command line or in your `.tps/.tpsrc` file.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="cli">

Lets say your project always uses a `tsx` extension for its components. You can
add `tsx` to the `extension` answer when creating a new instance and you will no
longer be prompted that question

```bash
tps react-component Nav --extension=tsx
```

Produces:

```txt
| - Nav
	| - index.tsx
	| - Nav.tsx
	| - Nav.css
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value=".tps/.tpsrc">

If you havent already initialize your repo:

```bash
tps init
```

Lets say your project always uses a `tsx` extension for its components. You can
add `tsx` to the `extension` answer.

```json title=".tps/.tpsrc"
{
	"react-component": {
		"answers": {
			"extension": "tsx"
		}
	}
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### No new folder

By default, templates creates a new folder for you. If you don't want a new
folder for your react component, you can use the
[`newFolder`](../../api/template#new-folder) and
[`index`](./react-component#options) options. These options both default to true

The [`newFolder`](../../api/template#new-folder) option tells templates whether
or not to place everything into a new folder.

The [`index`](./react-component#options) option determines whether a `index.js`
file should be created.

Lets say you have a basic react folder structure like so:

```text
| - <cwd>/
	| - src/
		// highlight-start
		| - components/
			| - Nav.js
			| - Nav.css
			// highlight-end
		| - pages/
			| - ...
		| - index.js
		| - app.js
	| - package.json
	| - package-lock.json
```

If you wanted to generate a new component called `footer` in the components
folder without a new folder, you can do one of the following:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="cli">

You can pass in the following flags when your generating your new instance

```bash
tps react-component footer --no-newFolder --no-index
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value=".tps/.tpsrc">

You can add the following to your `.tps/.tpsrc` file to always avoid creating a
new folder when generating a React component in your repository directory and
all its subdirectories.

If you havent already initialize your repo:

```bash
tps init
```

```json title=".tps/.tpsrc"
{
	"react-component": {
		"answers": {
			"index": false
		},
		"opts": {
			"newFolder": false
		}
	}
}
```

Now when generating a new instance

```bash
tps react-component footer
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Depending on your answers, it would produce something to the following:

```text
| - <cwd>/
	| - src/
		| - components/
			| - nav.js
			| - nav.css
			// highlight-start
			| - footer.js
			| - footer.css
			// highlight-end
		| - pages/
			| - ...
		| - index.js
		| - app.js
	| - package.json
	| - package-lock.json
```

### How to use with typescript

When generating a new instance of this template you will be asked if you want to
use typescript. However if you know you want to use typescript in your project
you can do one of the following:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="cli">

You can pass in the following flags when your generating your new instance and
you will no longer be prompted those questions

```bash
tps react-component Nav --typescript --extension=tsx

# or

tps react-component Nav --typescript -e tsx
```

Produces:

```txt
| - Nav
	| - index.tsx
	| - Nav.tsx
	| - Nav.css
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value=".tps/.tpsrc">

You can add the following to your `.tps/.tpsrc` file to always use typescript
when generating a react component in your repos directory and all its
subdirectories.

If you havent already initialize your repo:

```bash
tps init
```

```json title=".tps/.tpsrc"
{
	"react-component": {
		"answers": {
			"typescript": true,
			"extension": "tsx"
		}
	}
}
```

Now when generating a new instance you no longer will be prompted for these two
questions or have to supply the two flags to the cli command

```bash
tps react-component Nav
```

Would produce:

```txt
| - Nav
	| - index.tsx
	| - Nav.tsx
	| - Nav.css
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Use all default answers

To bypass all prompts and use default answers, simply include the `--default`
flag when generating a new instance.

```bash
tps react-component --default
```

You can also combined this with other flags and/or in conjunction with your
`.tps/.tpsrc`

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="cli">

Use typescript and use defaults for the rest of the questions. This will no
longer prompt you any questions

```bash
tps react-component Nav --typescript --default
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value=".tps/.tpsrc">

If you have typescript set in your tpsrc file.

```json title=".tps/.tpsrc"
{
	"react-component": {
		"answers": {
			"typescript": true
		}
	}
}
```

Now when using defaults it will use the typescript, defaults for the rest of the
questions, and will no longer prompt any questions.

```bash
tps react-component Nav --default
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
