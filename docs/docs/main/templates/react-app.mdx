Generate a fully functioning react app. This templates is heavily inspired from
[create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). However we support
[react-router](https://reactrouter.com/), typescript, and different package
managers by default.

:::caution

This template is in its alpha stage and will be evolving rapidly with new
features and updates. Changes may include directory structures, react app
patterns, and more. We are also planning to support:

-   css languages
    -   scss
    -   less
    -   css modules
    -   css
-   bundlers
    -   webpack
    -   esbuild
    -   vite
-   compilers
    -   babel
    -   swc
-   state managment
    -   redux
    -   Zustand
    -   React Query
-   Linters
    -   biome
    -   eslint

We welcome your feedback! Feel free to share ideas for tools or linraries you'd
like to see supported, or any thoughts you have on the structure of the react
app and the libraries we use.

## Examples

### How to use

This template generates a fully functional react app. The name you provide to
the CLI will be used for both the app's directory and the `package.json` name.
To create the app in a specific directory, prepend the directory path to the
name.

**Example:**

If you're building a new react app for a restaurant called `chickens-burgers`,
you would run the following command:

```bash
tps react-app chickens-burgers

# if you want this directory in say a directory called projects, then run the following command
tps react-app ./project/chickens-burgers
```

This will create a new directory called `chickens-burgers`, set up all the
necessary files and directories for your react app, and install the required
packages using your preferred package manager.

```txt
|- chickens-burgers/
    | public/
        | - ...
    | - src/
        | routes/
            | - Home/
                | - Home.js
                | - Home.css
                | - Home.test.js
                | index.js
        | - App.js
        | - App.test.js
        | - index.js
        | - index.css
        | reportWebVitals.js
        | setupTests.js
    | - .gitignore
    | - package.json
    | - package-lock.json
    | - README.md
```

Once your template is created, you can cd into the directory and run the
following command to start the app:

```bash
npm run start

# dev mode with nodemon
npm run dev
```

### Typescript

Use the `typescript` option to create a react app in typescript. This option
will change all `js` extensions to `tsx` or `ts`, adds a `tsconfig.json` file,
add some types to various areas of the codebase, and modify the package.json to
support typescript.

**Example:**

If you're building a new Express app for a restaurant called chickens-burgers,
you would run the following command:

```bash
tps react-app chickens-burgers --typescript

# if you want this directory in say a directory called projects, then run the following command

tps react-app ./project/chickens-burgers --typescript
```

This will create a new directory called `chickens-burgers`, set up all the
necessary files and directories for your react app, and install the required
packages using your preferred package manager.

```txt
|- chickens-burgers/
    | public/
        | - ...
    | - src/
        | routes/
            | - Home/
                | - Home.tsx
                | - Home.css
                | - Home.test.tsx
                | index.ts
        | - App.tsx
        | - App.test.tsx
        | - index.tsx
        | - index.css
        | - react-app-env.d.ts
        | - reportWebVitals.ts
        | - setupTests.ts
    | - .gitignore
    | - package.json
    | - package-lock.json
    | - tsconfig.json
    | - README.md
```
