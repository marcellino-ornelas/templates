# Welcome to Templates

Templates is a framework for creating reusable file structures and code, saving
you time and energy from starting from scratch. Our dynamic features allow
templates to prompt users for information, render dynamic values, conditionally
rendering code and the files system, and more. Whether you want to build a
template for a full-stack web application, a React or Angular component, or
something custom for your codebase, Templates can handle it all!

Learn how to create your own template or explore our collection of pre-made
templates, like our popular [react-component](./templates/react-component.mdx)
template.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g templates-mo
```

## Coming from Create-components-react?

Welcome friends! Your support for my packages is truly appreciated. To make
migration eaiser, we have developed a
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component) template that is available
right out of the box.

To get started, head over to the
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component) documentation, where you'll
find all the valuable information you need to make the most of this template.

### Migrate your react component template

If you would like migrate your old create components react component into a
templates equivilent, you can do so with the migrate command

By default it will put your template inside a `react-component` template

```bash
tps migrate
```

or you can change the name of the new template by adding a name:

```bash
tps migrate some-name
```

:::caution

The default `react-component` name will conflict with templates default
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component) template. This means that you
will not be able to access templates version of this template . We assume this
is ok since create components react purpose was for react components. If you
still would like access to templates default template then we recommend to
change the name
