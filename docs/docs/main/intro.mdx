# Welcome to Templates

:::info

Templates is commonly referred as `tps`. Any mentions to `tps` is referring to
the whole library and not individual templates you can create. Dont worry we
will go over this later

:::

Hey there! As a developer, you know that writing code can sometimes get
repetitive. Well, here's a fantastic solution for you: Templates!

Templates are like handy collections of files and code that you can use over and
over again. Imagine having a set of blueprints for specific pieces of code, like
entire React component, API controllers, or any other parts of your project.
Instead of just small code snippets, templates encompass entire file structures,
allowing you to include not just code, but also folders, configuration files,
and more!

When you create a template, it becomes your go-to tool for speeding up your
workflow. Rather than manually piecing together code snippets, templates
generate entire sections of your project instantly. This is especially useful
for larger pieces of code or complete project architectures.

The beauty of templates lies in their dynamic nature. You have the freedom to
include logic, conditional statements, and dynamic values within your code. This
means your templates can adapt and change based on the context or user input,
making them incredibly flexible and powerful.

So, whether you're building a web app, mobile project, or anything else,
templates are your dynamic coding superheroes! They save you time, ensure
consistency, and help you avoid repetitive tasks. Give it a try and witness how
templates take your coding game to the next level!"

## Coming from Create-components-react?

Hello, wonderful friends! Your support for my packages is truly appreciated. To
enhance your development experience, we have thoughtfully crafted a
`react-component` template that comes right out of the box for an easy
transition! Exciting, right?

To get started, head over to the
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component) template documentation. There,
you'll find all the valuable information you need to make the most of this
template. Ready to make a new template? Check out our
[create a new template docs](./create-new-template/)

### Migrate your react component template

If you would like migrate your old create components react component into a
templates equivilent, you can do so with the migrate command

By default it will put your template inside a `react-component` template

```bash
tps migrate
```

or you can change the name of the new template by adding a name:

```bash
tps migrate some-name
```

:::caution

The default `react-component` name will conflict with templates default
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component) template. This means that you
will not be able to access templates version of this template . We assume this
is ok since create components react purpose was for react components. If you
still would like access to templates default template then we recommend to
change the name
