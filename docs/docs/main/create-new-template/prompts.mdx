# Prompting

## What is a prompt

```bash
tps react-component Nav
? Would you like to include unit tests? (Y/n)
```

Prompting is a useful feature that allows you to obtain data from the user. By
displaying a message on the command line, we can request a response from the
user. Additionally, prompts can be answered by providing a flag via the command
line or through the node module package, which is particularly helpful when
users already know their desired input. The options for prompts can vary in
various formats.

In our system, we utilize the
[inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/tree/v6.0.0) library for
prompting. This enables you to use any property available in inquirer when
creating prompts. For more information on the available properties in inquirer,
you can refer to the documentation
[here](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/tree/v6.0.0).

## How to make a Prompt

To add prompts to your template, simply add a `prompts` property to your
settings file, which should be an array consisting of the prompts you wish to
present to the user. Each prompt will be represented as an object, with varying
properties depending on the type of prompt.

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        /* prompts ... */
    ]
}
```

:::tip

Don't remember what the setting file is? Refresh your memory in the
[settings files guide](./settings)

:::

Now lets go over some of the basics. To get a full list of properties check out
the [Prompts API documentation](../../api/settings/prompt)

### Name

Let's start with the `name` field. This field is essential for enabling
prompting functionality. All of your prompt answers will be conveniently stored
under the [`tps.answers`](../../api/template-context#answers) object property.

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            // highlight-next-line
            "name": "<some-name>"
            // ...
        }
    ]
}
```

The name you provide to the prompt will be used in order to access the users
answer.

```js
{{= tps.answers["<name-of-prompt>"]}}
```

<Example>

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            // highlight-next-line
            "name": "age"
            // ...
        }
    ]
}
```

you can access the users answer with:

```text
{{= tps.answers.age }}
```

</Example>

---

### Message

The second property is `message`. This property will tell inquirer what to ask
the user when they are rendering a new instance.

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            // highlight-next-line
            "message": "<some-message>"
            // ...
        }
    ]
}
```

<Example>

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            "name": "unit",
            // highlight-next-line
            "message": "Would you like to include unit tests?"
        }
    ]
}
```

When the user renders a new instance they will see the message added in your
prompt

```bash
tps react-component Nav
# highlight-next-line
? Would you like to include unit tests?
```

</Example>

---

### Type

The next property is `type`. This property will tell inquirer what type of
prompting you would like to use. You can see more about this property in the
[inquirer question docs](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/tree/v6.0.0#question).

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            // highlight-next-line
            "type": "confirm | input | checkbox | list | rawlist | password"
            // ...
        }
    ]
}
```

<Example>

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            "name": "over18",
            // highlight-next-line
            "type": "confirm",
            "message": "Are you over the age of 18?"
        }
    ]
}
```

Produces

```bash
tps react-component Nav
? Are you over the age of 18?
```

</Example>

---

### Tps Type

The next field is `tpsType`. This field tells tps how it should process the
users answer. There are two options `package` or `data`.

:::note

If you don't specify a `tpsType` field. Tps will use `package` by default.

:::

#### package

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            // highlight-next-line
            "tpsType": "package"
            // ...
        }
    ]
}
```

When you have `package` as the `tpsType`, tps will try to use the users value to
render a package that is in your template. Different values passed in will have
different behaviors.

##### boolean

In the case where a prompt's answer is a boolean and its value is `true`, Tps
will utilize the **name** of the prompt to search for a package with the same
name. If such a package is found, tps will include it during the rendering
process of the new instance. When the value is `false`, tps will disregard the
prompt and do nothing.

:::important

Prompts of type `confirm` will return their answers as booleans.

:::

<Example>

Say were rendering a new `express-app` instance and we have a prompt like so

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            "name": "unit",
            "tpsType": "package",
            "type": "confirm",
            "message": "Do you want to include unit tests?"
        }
    ]
}
```

since this is declared as a package type, this needs a corresponding package in
the template

```text
| - .tps/
    | - express-app/
        | settings.json
        | - default/
            | - server.js
        // highlight-next-line
        | - unit/        <-- matches name of prompt
            | - server.test.js
```

When the user is rendering a new template, the prompt will be displayed and they
can answer.

```bash
tps express-app newApp
? Would you like to include unit tests?
```

Depending on what the user answers depends on what will happen:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yes" label="User answers yes">

If user answers `yes`, then the `unit` package will be included in the rendering
process so a `server.test.js` will be added

```text
| - newApp/
    | - server.js
    // highlight-next-line
    | - server.test.js
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="no"  label="User answers no">

If user answers `no`, then the `unit` package will not be include in the
rendering process so no `server.test.js`.

```text
| - newApp/
    | - server.js
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</Example>

###### string

When a prompt's answer is a string, word or name, tps will take that answer and
attempt to find a package that corresponds to it. If one is found then tps will
include it in the rendering process.

:::important

Prompts of type `list` and `input` will return their answers as strings.

:::

<Example>

Say were rendering a new `express-app` instance and we have a prompt like so

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            "name": "framework",
            "tpsType": "package",
            "message": "What type of frontend framework would you like to use?",
            // highlight-start
            "type": "list", // <--- makes prompt accept strings
            "choices": ["react", "angular"]
            // highlight-end
        }
    ]
}
```

since this is declared as a package type, the choices to the question must match
a package in our template.

```text
| - .tps/
    | - express-app/
        | settings.json
        | - default/
            | - server.js
        // highlight-start
        | - react/
            | - react.js
        | - angular/
            | - angular.js
        // highlight-end
```

When the user is rendering a new instance, the prompt will be displayed and the
user can answer.

```bash
tps express-app newApp
? What type of framework would you like to use?
> react
  angular
```

With the choice the user selects, tps will then include a package that matches
the answer

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="react" label="User answers react">

If user answers `react`, then the `react` package will be included in the
rendering process so a `react.js` will be added

```text
| - newApp/
    | - server.js
    // highlight-next-line
    | - react.js
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="angular"  label="User answers angular">

If user answers `angular`, then the `angular` package will be included in the
rendering process so a `angular.js` will be added

```text
| - newApp/
    | - server.js
    // highlight-next-line
    | - angular.js
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</Example>

###### list

If a prompt's answer consists of a list of strings, tps will consider each
individual answer and locate the corresponding packages associated with them.
These packages will then be included during the rendering process.

:::important

Prompts of type `checkbox` will return their answer as list of strings.

:::

<Example>

Say were rendering a new `express-app` instance and we have a prompt like so

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            "name": "extras",
            "message": "Would you like to include any other features?",
            "tpsType": "package",
            // highlight-start
            "type": "checkbox", // <--- makes prompt accept list of strings
            "choices": ["metrics", "unit", "e2e", "api"]
            // highlight-end
        }
    ]
}
```

since this is declared as a package type, the choices to the question must match
a package in our template.

```text
| - .tps/
    | - express-app/
        | settings.json
        | - default/
            | - server.js
        // highlight-start
        | - metrics/
            | - metrics.js
        | - unit/
            | - server.test.js
        | - e2e/
            | - website.test.js
        | - api/
            | - api.js
        // highlight-end
```

When the user renders a new template. tps will ask for an list of inputs.
Whatever the user answers, tps will take all of the values and try to find a
packages that matches the answers.

If the user answers `metrics` and `unit` then both packages will be included in
the rendering process

```text
| - newApp/
    // highlight-next-line
    | - metrics.js
    // highlight-next-line
    | - server.test.js
    | - server.js
```

</Example>

#### data

```json
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            // highlight-next-line
            "tpsType": "data"
            // ...
        }
    ]
}
```

When the `tpsType` is set to `data`, tps will leave the data untouched. This
data type is designed to allow you to retrieve additional information from the
user, which you can then process according to your specific needs. One common
use case for this is to conditionally render specific code within the file based
on the user's response to a certain question. Any inquirer [type](#type) can be
used.

<Example>

Say were rendering a new `express-app` instance and we have a prompt like so

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            "name": "security",
            "message": "Would you like to include common express security packages?",
            "tpsType": "data",
            // highlight-start
            "type": "confirm" // <--- makes prompt accept boolean
            // highlight-end
        }
    ]
}
```

When the user is rendering a new instance, the prompt will be displayed and the
user can answer. Whatever the user answers will now be available for use in your
dynamic files.

<Dot lang="js" tps={{ answers: {security: true}}}>

```text
const express = require("express");
{{{? tps.answers.security }}}
const helmet = require("helmet");
{{{?}}}

const app = express();

{{{? tps.answers.security }}}
app.use(helmet());

{{{?}}}
/* node code ... */
```

</Dot>
</Example>

---

### Aliases

The `aliases` option allows you to give aliases to your prompts. These aliases
can be used when answering prompts either through the command line, node, or a
[configuration file](../tpsrc.mdx). Take a look at our
[aliases docs](../generating-instance.mdx#aliases) to learn how to use them.

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            "name": "some-name",
            /* ... */
            // highlight-next-line
            "aliases": ["<alias-name>"]
        }
    ]
}
```

:::tip

On the command line, single letter aliases should be answered with a single dash
`-` and other names should be answered with two dashes `--`

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            "name": "name",
            "type": "input",
            /* ... */
            // highlight-next-line
            "aliases": ["n", "realName"]
        }
    ]
}
```

Now I can answer this prompt with one of the following

```bash
tps some-template test --name lino

# or

tps some-template test -n lino

# or

tps some-template test --realName lino
```

:::

<Example>

If we were rendering a new instance using the `express-app` template and had
this settings file

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            "name": "framework",
            "choices": ["react", "vue", "angular"],
            /* ... */
            "aliases": ["f"]
        }
    ]
}
```

Now we can answer the prompt question with the alias

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="command-line" label="Command line">

```bash
tps express-app app -f react
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node" label="Node">

```js
const Templates = require('tps');

const tps = new Templates('express-app');

tps.setAnswers({ f: 'react' });
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</Example>

---

### Hidden

<BadgeList>
    <VersionBadge version=">=v1.1.1" />
</BadgeList>

The `hidden` option makes the prompt a hidden prompt. Hidden prompts do not get
prompted by default. This is useful when you want to add more customizable logic
in your template but don't want to overwhelm users with a ton of prompt
questions. Check out the
[hidden prompts guide](../generating-instance.mdx#hidden-options) to see how to
use them.

```json
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            // highlight-next-line
            "hidden": true
            // ...
        }
    ]
}
```

<Example>

Lets say we had a template named `hidden-prompt-test` that had these two
prompts, one being a hidden prompt and the not.

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            "name": "prompt1",
            "message": "Would you like to include prompt1",
            "tpsType": "data",
            "type": "confirm"
        },
        {
            "name": "prompt2",
            "message": "Would you like to include prompt2",
            "tpsType": "data",
            "type": "confirm",
            // highlight-next-line
            "hidden": true
        }
    ]
}
```

when users generate a new instance by default, hidden prompts wont be prompted
so only `prompt1` will be prompted to the user.

```bash
tps hidden-prompt-test test
? Would you like to include prompt1 (n/Y)
```

</Example>
