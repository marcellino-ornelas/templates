# 3rd Party Templates

3rd party templates are templates that can be published to your choice of
package manager like npm, yarn, or pnpm. This allows other developers to use
your template by installing it globally or locally. There are special
considerations you need to think about that we'll cover in this guide:

-   [Naming](#naming)
-   [Where to store them](#where-to-store-them)
-   [How to publish them](#publishing)
-   [Dev and Production](#dev-and-production)

## Naming

The only requirement for 3rd party templates is that their name starts with
`tps-`. The main reason for this is to prevent naming conflicts with other
packages and to ensure your template shows up when running the
[list command](../../api/cli.mdx#list). Due to the number of folders that could
be present in `node_modules`, Templates does not search for templates that are
not prefixed with `tps-` in all `node_modules` directories. Don't worry! You can
still render instances on the CLI without the `tps-` prefix in the template
name.

Make sure your `package.json` name also uses this prefix! Using this prefix in
your GitHub repo name is not required but is considered good practice.

<Example>

    If you wanted to create a 3rd party template called
    `github-pull-request-template` then add the `tps-` prefix in the front of the
    name.

    ```text
    | - .tps/
        // highlight-next-line
        | - tps-github-pull-request-template/
            | - <template code...>
    ```

    Make sure to have a `package.json` and make sure the `name` property is the same as your template name:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "tps-github-pull-request-template"
    }
    ```

    When rendering new instance you can use the prefixed version or non prefixed
    version

    ```bash
    tps github-pull-request-template

    # Prefixed version
    tps tps-github-pull-request-template
    ```

</Example>

## Where to store them?

We recommend that you put 3rd party templates in your
[global `.tps`](./templates.mdx#global-templates) directory. This is because
global templates can be used anywhere in your file system. This allows you to
generate instances of this template for testing or use. Remember, Templates will
load templates from a `.tps` folder in your current working directory or any
parent directories, so you won't be able to test your template if it is not in a
`.tps` folder.

<Example>

    If you wanted to create a 3rd party template called
    `github-pull-request-template` that will generate a GitHub pull request template
    file, then your folder structure would look like this:

    ```text
    | - ~/
        | - .tps/
            | - tps-github-pull-request-template/
                | - <template code...>
    ```

</Example>

## Publishing

When you are ready to publish your template, you can publish it to your package
manager of choice. This will allow other developers to install your template and
use it in their projects. Templates don't require anything special when
publishing templates, so follow your favorite guide or video to publish npm,
yarn, or pnpm packages.

-   [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-publish)
-   [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/publish/)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/cli/publish)

:::caution

We have only tested using templates globally installed with `npm`. Please use
`npm` for global templates until we can verify other package managers. If you
try this and it doesn't work, please drop us an
[issue on GitHub](https://github.com/marcellino-ornelas/templates/issues).

Templates installed locally with `npm`, `yarn`, and `pnpm` shouldn't have any
issues.

:::

## Dev and Production

At times, you may want to have both a development and production version of your
template. This can be helpful for making changes locally and testing them
without affecting your production version, while still being able to access the
production version to ensure you are not causing any regressions.

To do this, you can prefix your global template folder with `-dev` in your
global `.tps` directory. This will allow you to render this template with
`<template-name>-dev`. Now you can install your template globally or locally and
use the production version with `<template-name>` and the development version
with `<template-name>-dev`.

:::danger

Don't change the name of the template in your `package.json`.

:::

<Example>

    If you had a 3rd party template called `tps-github-pull-request-template` and
    you want to have a dev and production version, you can change the folder name in your
    global `.tps` directory to `tps-github-pull-request-template-dev`.

    ```text
    | - ~/
        | - .tps/
            // highlight-next-line
            | - tps-github-pull-request-template-dev/
                | - <template code...>
    ```

    Now you can install your production version from npm, yarn, or pnpm with
    `tps-github-pull-request-template`.

    ```bash
    npm install -g tps-github-pull-request-template
    ```

    Now when you want to use your dev version you can use `tps-github-pull-request-template-dev`:

    ```bash
    tps github-pull-request-template-dev
    ```

    and when you want to use your PROD version you can use `tps-github-pull-request-template`:

    ```bash
    tps github-pull-request-template
    ```

</Example>

## Example

If you want an example of a 3rd party template, you can check out the
[ai template](https://github.com/marcellino-ornelas/tps-ai) for inspiration. We
use Github Actions to deploy our template to `npm`. Just be aware that this
template doesnt use any packages so it only contains a `settings.js` file.
