# Templates

:::note

We will be referring to `<some-name>` in our guide to represent any directory.

:::

A tps template is a collection of folders and files that acts as a blueprint for
recreating identical file structures in different locations. Think of this as a
google doc template but for files and folders. When generating a new instance of
this template, all files and directories within the template folder are rendered
into the your new instance's directory. Tps also supports conditionally rending
files and folders and dynamiclly rendering files and folders.

Don't worry about all this right now! More will be discussed later on. First,
let's start with the basics.

## Where do templates live

All templates need to live in a `.tps` folder. Subdirectories of the `.tps`
directory are your templates. You may have as many templates as you wish.

```text
| - .tps/
    // highlight-next-line
    | - <templates...>/
```

<Example>

If I were to make a new template called `react-component` then my folder
structure would look like this:

```text
| - .tps/
    | - react-component/
```

</Example>

## Packages

Inside of each `template` you can have directories referred to as `packages`.

```text
| - .tps/
    | - <template>/
        // highlight-next-line
        | - <packages...>/
```

Within each package directory, you have the freedom to add an unlimited number
of files and directories. These resources will then be utilized when generating
a new instance of your template. You can name packages anything you wish, but
TPS treats the `default` package as special. When rendering a new instance of a
template, TPS will automatically include all the contents _(files/directories)_
within your `default` package. All other packages will only be included if
explicitly specified.

<Example open>

Lets say we have a template called `node-server`. This template is responsible
for setting up a brand new node webserver with all the bells and whistles
included.

```text
| - .tps/
    | - node-server/
        | - default/
            // highlight-start
            | - server.js
            | - package.json
            // highlight-end
```

let's say today we had a new idea for a trash removal company called "Trash
Removal". If we wanted to build a new website for this company we can generate a
new instance of `node-server` called `trash-removal`. When templates generates
this new instance it will create a new directory called `trash-removal` and
generate copies of all files/directories inside the template's `default`
directory and place them into the new `trash-removal` directory it just created.

```text
// highlight-start
| - trash-removal/
    | - server.js
    | - package.json
// highlight-end
```

</Example>

Dont worry more will be covered on this in our [next section](./packages) of
this guide:

## Settings file

```text
| - .tps/
    | - <template>/
        // highlight-next-line
        | - settings.json
```

A template can optionally have a settings file where you can define prompts and
other configuration details. The settings file will be discussed in more detail
later in this guide.

:::note

You can learn more about the settings file in our
[settings file guide](./settings)

:::

## Dynamic files

Within each package, you can use dynamic files, which are files ending with a
`.tps` extension. Dynamic files allow you to utilize our template engine to
create dynamic content. This results in more flexibility and customization in
your templates.

## Making a new template

There is nothing special about a template. Its nothing other than a directory
holding a collection of files and folders. We could create a template two ways:

1. Use our command line tool _(recommended)_
2. Create the directories and files with `mkdir/touch` or use Finder etc.

:::note

Read more about our command line docs [here](../../api/cli)

:::

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="tps" label="tps cli" default>

Our command line tools will create the `default` folder for you.

```bash
tps new template <template-name>
```

:::note

Read more about our `new` command more [here](../../api/cli#new)

:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="bash">

```bash
mkdir .tps/<template-name>

mkdir .tps/<template-name>/default
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Generating a instance

Check out our [generating a instance](../generating-instance.mdx) guide to learn
how to generate your new template.
