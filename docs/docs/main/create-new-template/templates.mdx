# Templates

:::note

We will be referring to `<some-name>` in our guide to represent any directory.

:::

A template is a collection of folders and files that acts as a blueprint for
recreating identical file structures in different locations. Think of this as a
google doc template but for files and folders. When generating a new instance of
this template, all files and directories within the template folder are rendered
into the your new instance's directory. Templates also supports conditionally
and dynamiclly rendering files and folders.

Don't worry about all this right now! More will be discussed later on. First,
let's start with the basics.

## Template Types

There are 2 main types of templates:

-   [Local Templates](#local-templates)
-   [Global Templates](#global-templates)
    {/* -   [3rd Party Templates](#3rd-party-templates) */}

### Local Templates

Local templates are templates that live in your local directories. This could be
your repository directory, subdirectories of your repository directory, or any
directory on your file system. This is useful if you have repository-specific or
directory specific flows you are trying to automate. Local templates live in a
`.tps` folder. Subdirectories of the `.tps` directory are your templates.

```text
| - <your-repo>/
    | - .tps/
        // highlight-next-line
        | - <templates...>/
```

<Example>

    If I were to make a new template called `react-component` that will generate
    React components, then my folder structure would look like this:

    ```text
    | - <your-repo>/
        | - .tps/
            // highlight-next-line
            | - react-component/
                | - <template code...>
    ```

</Example>

:::tip

You can create this `.tps` directory by running:

```bash
tps init
```

:::

#### Multiple Template Folders

When using the Templates CLI, Templates can use any template that's defined in a
`.tps` directory in your current working directory or any parent directory. This
means you can define multiple template folders in your repository. This can be
useful when you want to segregate certain templates to specific parts of the
codebase. Keep in mind that in order to use subdirectory templates, your
terminal's current working directory needs to be that subdirectory.

```text
| - <your-repo>/
    // highlight-start
    | - .tps/
        | - <templates...>/
    // highlight-end
    | - some-sub-directory
        // highlight-start
        | - .tps/
            | - <templates...>/
        // highlight-end
```

<Example>

    If you had a separate folder for your app's frontend codebase, then you can
    define a `.tps` folder at the repo level and inside the frontend folder. This
    would allow you to keep frontend-specific templates out of the main directory.

    ```text
    | - my-repo/
        // highlight-start
        | - .tps/
            | - backend-api
            // highlight-end
        | - frontend
            // highlight-start
            | - .tps/
                | - react-component
            // highlight-end
    ```

    Now if your current working directory is `my-repo`, you will be able to use the
    `backend-api` template. If your current working directory is `frontend`, then
    you can use both `backend-api` and `react-component`.

</Example>

### Global Templates

Global templates are similar to local templates but they live in your home
directory. This is useful when you want to share templates across your whole
file system. These templates still need to live in a `.tps` directory.

```text
| - ~/
    | - .tps/
        // highlight-next-line
        | - <templates...>/
```

<Example>

    If I were to make a new template called `github-pull-request-template` that will generate
    React components, then my folder structure would look like this:

    ```text
    | - <your-repo>/
        | - .tps/
            // highlight-next-line
            | - react-component/
                | - <template code...>
    ```

</Example>

:::tip

You can create this global `.tps` directory by running:

```bash
tps init --global
```

{/* ### 3rd party Templates

3rd party templates are templates that will be published to your choice of
package manager like npm/yarn/pnpm. This allows other developers to use your
template by installing it globally or locally. There are special considerations
you need to think about when making 3rd party template that we will touch on in
our [3rd party templates guide](./3rd-party-templates.mdx). \*/}

## Packages

Inside of each `template` you can have directories referred to as `packages`.

```text
| - .tps/
    | - <template>/
        // highlight-next-line
        | - <packages...>/
```

Within each package directory, you have the freedom to add an unlimited number
of files and directories. These resources will then be utilized when generating
a new instance of your template. You can name packages anything you wish, but
Templates treats the `default` package as special. When rendering a new instance
of a template, Templates will automatically include all the contents
_(files/directories)_ within your `default` package. All other packages will
only be included if explicitly specified.

<Example open>

Lets say we have a template called `node-server`. This template is responsible
for setting up a brand new node webserver with all the bells and whistles
included.

```text
| - .tps/
    | - node-server/
        | - default/
            // highlight-start
            | - server.js
            | - package.json
            // highlight-end
```

let's say today we had a new idea for a trash removal company called "Trash
Removal". If we wanted to build a new website for this company we can generate a
new instance of `node-server` called `trash-removal`. When templates generates
this new instance it will create a new directory called `trash-removal` and
generate copies of all files/directories inside the template's `default`
directory and place them into the new `trash-removal` directory it just created.

```text
// highlight-start
| - trash-removal/
    | - server.js
    | - package.json
// highlight-end
```

</Example>

Dont worry more will be covered on this in our [next section](./packages) of
this guide:

## Settings file

```text
| - .tps/
    | - <template>/
        // highlight-next-line
        | - settings.json
```

A template can optionally have a settings file where you can define prompts and
other configuration details. The settings file will be discussed in more detail
later in this guide.

:::note

You can learn more about the settings file in our
[settings file guide](./settings)

:::

## Dynamic files

Within each package, you can use dynamic files, which are files ending with a
`.tps` extension. Dynamic files allow you to utilize our template engine to
create dynamic content. This results in more flexibility and customization in
your templates.

## Making a new template

There is nothing special about a template. Its nothing other than a directory
holding a collection of files and folders. We could create a template two ways:

1. Use our command line tool _(recommended)_
2. Create the directories and files with `mkdir/touch` or use Finder etc.

:::note

Read more about our command line docs [here](../../api/cli)

:::

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="tps" label="tps cli" default>

Our command line tools will create the `default` folder for you.

```bash
tps new template <template-name>
```

:::note

Read more about our `new` command more [here](../../api/cli#new)

:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bash" label="bash">

```bash
mkdir .tps/<template-name>

mkdir .tps/<template-name>/default
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
