# Templates

:::note

We will be referring to `<some-name>` in our guide to represent any directory.

:::

A tps template is a collection of folders and files that acts as a blueprint for
effortlessly recreating identical file structures in different locations. Think
of this as a google doc template but for files and folders. When rendering a tps
template, the tool scans all the files and directories within the template
folder, and renders them in a directory of your preference. Tps also allows you
to incorporate additional information during the template rendering process,
resulting in a more dynamic template.

Don't worry about all this right now! More will be discussed later on. First,
let's start with the basics.

## Where do templates live

All TPS templates need to live in a `.tps` folder. Subdirectories of the `.tps`
directory are your templates. You may have as many templates as you wish.

```text
| - .tps/
    // highlight-next-line
    | - <template...>/
```

<Example />

## Packages

Now lets break down what to put in your template folder. Inside of each
`template` you can have directories referred to as `packages`.

```text
| - .tps/
    | - <template>/
        // highlight-next-line
        | - <packages...>/
```

Now, within each package directory, you have the freedom to add an unlimited
number of files and directories. These resources will be utilized during the
template rendering process. You are free to name the packages as you wish, with
one exception. While each template can have a `default` package, it is not
mandatory to specify one.

Every time you render a template, tps will automatically utilize all the
contents _(files/directories)_ within your `default` package. For any additional
package contents that you wish to include in the rendering process, you must
explicitly specify them when rendering the template.

Dont worry more will be covered on this in our next section of this guide

You can learn more about packages in our [packages guide](./packages)

## Settings file

```text
| - .tps/
    | - <template>/
        // highlight-next-line
        | - settings.json
```

A template can optionally have a settings file where you can define prompts and
other configuration details. The settings file will be discussed in more detail
later in this guide.

:::note

You can learn more about the settings file in our
[settings file guide](./settings)

## Dynamic files

Within each package, you can use dynamic files. Dynamic files are files that end
with a `.dot` extension. These files enable you to leverage all the features
provided by [doT](http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html) within tps.

Dynamic files provide the capability to pass data and enhance the power of
dynamic rendering. By utilizing this data, you can leverage the features of doT
to conditionally render specific sections of code or perform other dynamic
operations. This allows for more flexibility and customization in your
templates.

## Making a new template

There is nothing special about a template. Its nothing other than a directory
holding a collection of files and folders. We could create a template two ways:

1. Use our command line tool _(recommended)_
2. Create the directories and files with `mkdir/touch` or use Finder etc.

## Rendering a new template

### what is rendering a template

Rendering a new template, also known as template instantiation or the template
instantiation process, refers to the action of utilizing a template as a
starting point to create a new instance. It involves rendering the files and
folders from the template folder and transferring them to the **build path(s)**.

<br />
<br />

```mermaid
graph LR;
    step1("User renders
    template")
    step2("Tps loads all files
    and folders from packages")
    step3("Tps creates a directory
    for the passed build path")
    step4("Creates all needed files and
    folders inside each build path")
    step1-->step2;
    step2-->step3;
    step3-->step4;
```

<br />
<br />

The `build path` is the information you provide to TPS to specify the location
and details of the new template to be created. It can be thought of as the name
or identifier for the new template. When TPS receives the build path, it creates
a directory with that name and renders all the files and folders from your
template packages into this newly created directory. In essence, the build path
acts as a directive to TPS, guiding it in assembling the new template by
organizing the appropriate files and folders in the designated directory.

### Single build path

When the build path is a single word, tps utilizes it as the name for your new
instance. It then generates a fresh directory with the given name within the
current directory you are in, and proceeds to render all contents within the
newly created directory.

```text
// highlight-next-line
app
|__|
 ^ Build path & template name
```

<Example />

### Long build path

If you give tps a long build path, it uses it as the path to create your new
template. The last word becomes the template name, and the words before that
show which directory you want the new instance to be in. If the directory doesnt
exist, tps will create it.

```text
// highlight-next-line
some/path/app
          |__| <- template name
|____________|
    ^ Build path
```

<Example />

### Multiple build paths

You can also pass in multiple build paths at the same time. This is going to be
the same as passing in one but for each one.

<Example />

### How to render a template

There are two ways on how to render a template. One is via our command line tool
or by our `node_module` package. We wont go deep into this topic right now but
here are some basics.

`<template-to-use>` is the name of the template you would like to use.

:::tip

Not sure what templates you have? Check out our
[list command](../../api/cli#list)

:::

`<build-paths...>` is the location/name of where you want your new rendered
template to go

  <TabItem value="tps" label="tps cli" default />
  <TabItem value="node" label="Node" />
</Tabs>
