# Templates

:::note

We will be referring to `<some-name>` in our guide to represent any directory.

:::

A tps template is a collection of folders and files that acts as a blueprint for
recreating identical file structures in different locations. Think of this as a
google doc template but for files and folders. When generating a new instance of
this template, all files and directories within the template folder are rendered
into the your new instance's directory. Tps also supports conditionally rending
files and folders and dynamiclly rendering files and folders.

Don't worry about all this right now! More will be discussed later on. First,
let's start with the basics.

## Where do templates live

All templates need to live in a `.tps` folder. Subdirectories of the `.tps`
directory are your templates. You may have as many templates as you wish.

```text
| - .tps/
    // highlight-next-line
    | - <templates...>/
```

<Example>

If I were to make a new template called `react-component` then my folder
structure would look like this:

```text
| - .tps/
    | - react-component/
```

</Example>

## Packages

Inside of each `template` you can have directories referred to as `packages`.

```text
| - .tps/
    | - <template>/
        // highlight-next-line
        | - <packages...>/
```

Within each package directory, you have the freedom to add an unlimited number
of files and directories. These resources will then be utilized when generating
a new instance of your template. You can name packages anything you wish, but
TPS treats the `default` package as special. When rendering a new instance of a
template, TPS will automatically include all the contents _(files/directories)_
within your `default` package. All other packages will only be included if
explicitly specified.

<Example open>

Lets say we have a template called `node-server`. This template is responsible
for setting up a brand new node webserver with all the bells and whistles
included.

```text
| - .tps/
    | - node-server/
        | - default/
            // highlight-start
            | - server.js
            | - package.json
            // highlight-end
```

let's say today we had a new idea for a trash removal company called "Trash
Removal". If we wanted to build a new website for this company we can generate a
new instance of `node-server` called `trash-removal`. When templates generates
this new instance it will create a new directory called `trash-removal` and
generate copies of all files/directories inside the template's `default`
directory and place them into the new `trash-removal` directory it just created.

```text
// highlight-start
| - trash-removal/
    | - server.js
    | - package.json
// highlight-end
```

</Example>

Dont worry more will be covered on this in our [next section](./packages) of
this guide:

## Settings file

```text
| - .tps/
    | - <template>/
        // highlight-next-line
        | - settings.json
```

A template can optionally have a settings file where you can define prompts and
other configuration details. The settings file will be discussed in more detail
later in this guide.

:::note

You can learn more about the settings file in our
[settings file guide](./settings)

:::

## Dynamic files

Within each package, you can use dynamic files, which are files ending with a
.tps extension. Dynamic files allow you to utilize our template engine to create
dynamic content. This results in more flexibility and customization in your
templates.

## Making a new template

There is nothing special about a template. Its nothing other than a directory
holding a collection of files and folders. We could create a template two ways:

1. Use our command line tool _(recommended)_
2. Create the directories and files with `mkdir/touch` or use Finder etc.

Our command line tools will create the `default` folder for you.

```bash
tps new template <template-name>
```

## Generating a new instance

### What is a new instance

Generating a new instance of a template, also known as template instantiation or
the template instantiation process, refers to the action of utilizing a template
as a starting point to create a new instance. It involves rendering the files
and folders from the template folder and transferring them to the **build
path(s)**.

<br />
<br />

```mermaid
graph LR;
    step1("User generates a
	new instance")
    step2("Tps loads all files
    and folders from packages")
    step3("Tps creates a directory
    for the passed build path")
    step4("Creates all needed files and
    folders inside each build path")
    step1-->step2;
    step2-->step3;
    step3-->step4;
```

<br />
<br />

The `build path` is the information you provide to TPS to specify the location
and details of the new template to be created. It can be thought of as the name
or identifier for the new template. When TPS receives the build path, it creates
a directory with that name and renders all the files and folders from your
template packages into this newly created directory. In essence, the build path
acts as a directive to TPS, guiding it in assembling the new template by
organizing the appropriate files and folders in the designated directory.

### Single build path

When the build path is a single word, tps utilizes it as the name for your new
instance. It then generates a fresh directory with the given name within the
current directory you are in, and proceeds to render all contents within the
newly created directory.

```text
// highlight-next-line
app
|__|
 ^ Build path & template name
```

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance from a template and we have the build path
`app` then templates will create a new directory called `app` and render all
contents inside of it

```text title="Template structure"
| - .tps/
    // highlight-start
    | - node-server/
        | - default/
            | - server.js
            | - package.json
    // highlight-end
```

```text title="Rendered instance"
// highlight-start
| - app/
    | - server.js
    | - package.json
// highlight-end
```

</Example>

### Long build path

If you give tps a long build path, it uses it as the path to create your new
template. The last word becomes the template name, and the words before that
show which directory you want the new instance to be in. If the directory doesnt
exist, tps will create it.

```text
// highlight-next-line
some/path/app
          |__| <- template name
|____________|
    ^ Build path
```

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance from a template and we have the build path
`code/projects/app` then templates will create a new directory called `app`
inside of `<cwd>/code/projects` and render all contents inside of it.

```text title="Template structure"
| - .tps/
    // highlight-start
    | - node-server/
        | - default/
            | - server.js
            | - package.json
    // highlight-end
```

```text title="Rendered instance"
|- code
    |- projects
        // highlight-start
        | - app/
            | - server.js
            | - package.json
        // highlight-end
```

</Example>

### Multiple build paths

You can also pass in multiple build paths at the same time. This is going to be
the same as passing in one but for each one.

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance from a template and we have the build paths
`code/projects/app` & `code/projects/app2` then templates will create new
directories for both and render contents into both of them.

```text title="Template structure"
| - .tps/
    // highlight-start
    | - node-server/
        | - default/
            | - server.js
            | - package.json
    // highlight-end
```

```text title="Rendered instance"
|- code
    |- projects
        // highlight-start
        | - app/
            | - server.js
            | - package.json
        | - app2/
            | - server.js
            | - package.json
        // highlight-end
```

</Example>

### How to generate a new instance

There are two ways on how to generate a new instance of a template. One is via
our command line tool or by our `node_module` package. We wont go deep into this
topic right now but here are some basics.

`<template-to-use>` is the name of the template you would like to use.

:::tip

Not sure what templates you have? Check out our
[list command](../../api/cli#list)

:::

`<build-paths...>` is the location/name of where you want your new rendered
template to go

<Tabs groupId="cli-node">
  <TabItem value="tps" label="tps cli" default>

```bash
# create command

tps create --use=<template-to-use> <build-paths...>

# or use command

tps <template-to-use> <build-paths...>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="node" label="Node">

```js
const Templates = require('tps');

const tps = new Templates('<template-to-use>');
// ^ In js pass in the name to the template here

const buildPaths = ['<build-paths...>'];
// ^ In js build paths should always be an array

tps.render('<some-directory-path>', buildPaths);
// ^ In js we need to add a path to some directory so tps has a
// starting directory. tps cli tools uses this node module
// underneath the hood and uses the terminals current working
// directory as the `<some-directory-path>` path
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
