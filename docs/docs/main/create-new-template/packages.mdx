# Packages

## What is a package?

Packages are the building blocks of a template. But its also, nothing special
either. Its only a directory that will hold more files and directories. The
package's files and folders are used when rendering your template.

All packages live inside of a tps `template` folder

```text
| - .tps/
    | - some-template/
        // highlight-next-line
        | - <packages...>/
```

`packages` can be named whatever you like except for one. Each `template` can
optionally have a `default` package. Each time you generate a new instance of a
template, TPS will automatically use everything inside your `default` package to
build your template. Every other package that you want to be rendered must be
specified when rendering the template.

Packages are used to enhance a template or add extra features when a user wants
them. Its kind of like a conditional.

If that doesn't make sense then think of it this way. Imaging rendering a
template was like ordering a cheeseburger. Now a basic cheeseburger will
probably come with meat, lettuce, and cheese. But! if you wanted to make the
cheeseburger more tasty and awesome. You can "add" more ingredients like bacon,
mushrooms, and etc _("our packages")_.

### Default package

As mentioned before, when you generate a new instance of a template, all
contents from the `default` package are automatically included. Think of this
package as a central storage space for important things needed every time you
use a template. It keeps all the essential elements in one place.

```text title="Template"
| - .tps/
    | - some-template/
        | - default/
            // highlight-next-line
            | - <all of the default package files/folders...>
```

```text title="Result"
| - app/
    // highlight-next-line
    | - <all of the default package files/folders...>
```

<Example open>

Lets say we have a template called `node-server`. This template is responsible
for setting up a brand new webserver with all the bells and whistles included.

```text title="Template"
| - .tps/
    | - node-server/
        | - default/
            | - server.js
            | - package.json
```

let's say today we had a new idea for a trash removal company called
`trash-removal`. If we wanted to generate this app with our template then it
would create a new directory called `trash-removal` and render all files inside
the templates `default` package and place them into the new `trash-removal`
directory it just created

```bash title="Command"
tps node-server trash-removal
```

```text title="Result"
| - trash-removal/
    // highlight-start
    | - server.js
    | - package.json
    // highlight-end
```

</Example>

### Using additional packages

If your rendering a template thats going to use additional packages. All of the
files and folders, from the packages you use, will be included when rendering
that template. If we were to render a new template called `app` and also use an
additional package `package2`. then both `default` and `package2` files and
folders will be copied over to `app`. You can have and include as many packages
as you wish.

```text
| - .tps/
    | - <template>/
        // highlight-start
        | - default/
            | - <default files/folders...>
        | - package2/
            | - <package2 files/folders...>
        // highlight-end

| - app/
    // highlight-start
    | - <default files/folder...>
    | - <package2 files/folders...>
    // highlight-end
```

If you have more than one package but don't specific that you want to use any
additional ones. Your app folder will only be the files and folders from
`default`.

```text
| - .tps/
    | - <template>/
        | - default/
            | - <default files/folders...>
        | - package2/
            | - <package2 files/folders...>

| - app/
    // highlight-next-line
    | - <default files/folders...>
```

<Example open title="Using additional packages">

Lets say we have a template called `node-server`. This template is responsible
for setting up a brand new webserver with all the bells and whistles included
and optionally can set up unit tests for us

```text title="Template"
| - .tps/
    | - node-server/
        | - default/
            | - server.js
            | - package.json
        | - unit-tests/
            | - server.test.js
```

Now if we wanted to create a new app but have unit tests set up for us alrealy
then we can run

```bash title="Command"
tps node-server trash-removal --packages unit-tests
```

```text title="Result"
| - trash-removal/
    // highlight-start
    | - server.js
    | - server.test.js
    | - package.json
    // highlight-end
```

</Example>

<Example open title="Having additional packages but not using them">

Lets say we have a template called `node-server`. This template is responsible
for setting up a brand new webserver with all the bells and whistles included
and optionally can set up unit tests for us

```text title="Template"
| - .tps/
    | - node-server/
        | - default/
            | - server.js
            | - package.json
        | - unit-tests/
            | - server.test.js
```

Now if we wanted to create a new app but we didnt want unit tests for this app
then you could run.

```bash title="Command"
tps node-server trash-removal
```

```text title="Result"
| - trash-removal/
    // highlight-start
    | - server.js
    | - package.json
    // highlight-end
```

:::tip

Remember additional packages must be explicily included

:::

</Example>

### Prompts

Tps also has the abilities to prompt users for there input. As a template
creator, you can define prompts in a settings.json file. When users attempt to
render the template, TPS will prompt them questions and dynamically adjusts its
behavior based on the users response

```bash
tps node-server new-app
# highlight-next-line
? Would you like to include unit tests? (true)
```

In this case, if the user answers "yes" to the question, tps will include an
extra package during the rendering process. This package will have the necessary
materials for conducting unit tests. however if they chose against this then tps
would not include anything from the unit test package

Dont worry well go over this more in depth in our [prompts guide](./prompts)

## Making a new package

To make a new package use the bash commands

<Tabs> 
<TabItem value="tps" label="tps cli" default>

```bash
tps new package <template> <package-name>
```

:::note

Read more about our `new` command more [here](../../api/cli#new)

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bash" label="bash">

```bash
mkdir ./.tps/<template>/<package-name>
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using a new package

Add the `--packages` flag to your tps create command to add more packages. This
flag takes an array of options.

```bash
tps <template> <template-name-to-create> --packages <package> [packages...]
```

:::note

If you add the flag before the template or template name your creating, you must
add `--` right before you start to put the template you want to create so
[yargs](http://yargs.js.org/) can parse correctly

```bash
tps <template> --packages <package> [packages...] -- <template-name-to-create>
```

:::

<Example open>

one package

```bash
tps node-server app --packages unit-tests
```

multiple packages

```bash
tps node-server app --packages unit-tests sql redis
```

</Example>
