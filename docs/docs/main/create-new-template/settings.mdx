# Settings File

Tps allows you to have a settings file in your template to add certain
actions/configurations when generating your template. The settings file can be a
`settings.json` or `settings.js` in your template folder at the same level as
your packages. The main use for this file is prompting but well be adding more
features very soon.

```text
| - .tps
	| - some-template
		// highlight-next-line
		| - settings.json
		| - default
			| - <files...>
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="json">

```json title="settings.json"
{}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="js">

```js title="settings.js"
module.exports = {};
```

:::warning

Please note that `export default` has not been thoroughly tested and may not
perform as anticipated. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for

greatly value contributions and welcome any input you may have.
