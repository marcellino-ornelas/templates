# Generating an Instance

Generating an instance of a template involves creating a new entity based on the
contents of your template. During this process, templates will take the files
and folders defined in the template and render them to your build path(s).

## What is a Build Path

The build path is a combination of an name and an optional location that you
provide to templates. Templates uses this build path to determine where to
render your instance file and folders.

The `name` represents the instance identifer. Templates will create a new
directory based off the name supplied and generate all templates contents into
that directory.

The `location` tell templates where to put this new instance. This is useful if
you dont want your instance generated in the directory your in.

The build path resembles a linux file path pattern and there are 4 main
variations you can utilize:

-   Short build path
-   Long build path
-   Multiple build paths
-   No build path

### Short build path

A short build path is a build path that only contains a `name`.

```text
// highlight-next-line
my-food-app
|__________|
 ^ Build path and instance name
```

Like mentioned before, templates creates a new directory with this `name` and
renders the tenmplates contents into the directory. Templates also assigns this
`name` as the instances `name`. This `name` can also be used internally by the
template in places that require a name.

Some examples of this could be:

-   The name of a react component
-   The name of your new express app and name in package json
-   etc, etc

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance of a template name `node-server` and we
have the build path of `my-food-app` then templates will create a new directory
called `my-food-app` and render all the templates contents inside of it

```text
// highlight-start
| - my-food-app/
    | - <node-server contents...>
// highlight-end
```

</Example>

### Long build path

A long build path is a build path that contains a `location` and `name`.

```text
// highlight-next-line
projects/my-food-app
|______| |_________|
^ location    ^ instance name
|___________________|
       ^ build path
```

Templates still follows all the rules of a single build path. However the
directory thats created based on the `name` is created inside the `location`. In
case above, `my-food-app` instance will be created in the `projects` directory.

:::note

If the `location` is not a valid directory, then directory will be created in
this process

:::

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance of a template named `node-server` and we
have the build path `code/projects/my-food-app` then templates will create a new
directory called `my-food-app` inside of `<cwd>/code/projects` and render all
the templates contents inside.

```text title="Rendered instance"
|- code
    |- projects
        // highlight-start
        | - my-food-app/
            | - <node-server contents...>
        // highlight-end
```

</Example>

### Multiple build paths

Multiple build paths are a way to create multiple instances of a template in a
single process. When defining multile build paths you can use a mix of short and
long builds paths:

```text
projects/my-food-app projects/my-gas-app my-food-app-2
|__________________| |_________________| |____________|
    ^ build path 1        ^ build path 2      ^ build path 3
```

Templates will generate instances for all build paths and each instance's build
path will follow the same rules as if you were just generating a single
instance. While generating multiple instances may not make sense for every
single template, this is very powerful when using a template that generates a
subset of your application like a react component, Api route, background job
file, etc.

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance of a template named `node-server` and we
have the build paths `projects/my-food-app` & `projects/my-gas-app` then
templates will create both instances in the `projects` directory.

```text title="Rendered instance"
|- projects
    // highlight-start
    | - my-food-app/
        | - <node-server contents...>
    | - my-gas-app/
        | - <node-server contents...>
    // highlight-end
```

</Example>

### No Build path

Some template's dont need a build path to generate a new instance. This is
because they dont need a new folder or any unique instance name to generate your
content. Some examples of this can be a template that creates a eslint
configuration file, jest configuration file, or anything in this similar vain.

:::caution

Always refer to the template's documention page to see how they want you to use
their template

:::

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance of a template named `eslint` and we didnt
specific a build path, it could create something like the following:

```text title="Rendered instance"
|- <cwd>
    // highlight-start
    | - <eslint contents...>
    // highlight-end
```

</Example>

:::note

Templates will still allow you to provide a build path to a template that
doesn't require one. Templates will still follow the rules of a build path and
place all templates contents into it.

If a build path is not supplied to a template that requires one, you will have
unexpected result's. Templates has no knowledge of whether or not a template
requires a build path and will not error out. This may change in future versions
of templates. Always refer to the template's documention recommended way to use
the template.

## How to generate a new instance

Our CLI is our primary way to generate new instances of a template. You can
access the CLI after [installation](./intro#installation) with the `tps`
command:

```bash
tps <template-name> [build-paths...]
```

Replace `<template-name>` with the name of the template you want to use and add
any build paths afterward.

```bash
# Short build path
tps my-template instance1

# Long build path
tps my-template path/to/dir/instance1

# Multiple build paths
tps my-template instance1 path/to/dir/instance2

# No build path
tps my-template
```

<Example>

If you wanted to use our [`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx)
template you would replace `<template-name>` with `react-component` and then the
component you want to create afterwards (E.g.
[build path](#what-is-a-build-path)). For this demo, well be creating a `Nav`
component:

```bash
tps react-component Nav
```

This will then generate something similar to the follow:

```text
| - <cwd>
    | - Nav/
        | - <react-component contents...>
```

You can use a [long build path](#long-build-path) if you want to place this
instance in a sub directory.

Example, its common for some components like a nav to live in a
`src/components/` directory so using the same
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx) template and component
`Nav`, you can use the following to generate the `Nav` instance in
`src/components/`:

```bash
tps react-component src/components/Nav
```

If you want to generate multiple instances at the same time you can use
something similar to the following:

```bash
tps react-component src/components/Nav src/components/Footer
```
