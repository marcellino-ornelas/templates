# Generating an Instance

Generating an instance of a template involves creating a new entity based on the
template's contents. During this process, Templates takes the files and folders
defined in the template and renders them to your build path(s).

## What is a Build Path

The build path is a combination of a name and an optional location that you
provide to Templates. Templates uses this build path to determine where to
render your instance.

The `name` represents the instance identifier. Templates creates a new directory
based on the supplied name—unless told not to—and generates all template
contents into that directory. This `name` may also be used internally by the
template in areas requiring a unique identifier.

The `location` specifies where Templates should place the new instance. This is
useful if you don&apos;t want the instance generated in your current directory.

The build path follows a Linux-style file path pattern, and there are four main
variations you can use

-   Short build path
-   Long build path
-   Multiple build paths
-   No build path

### Short build path

A short build path is a build path that only contains a `name`.

```text
// highlight-next-line
my-food-app
|__________|
 ^ Build path and instance name
```

Like mentioned earlier, Templates creates a new directory with this `name` in
your cwd. It then renders the template’s contents into that directory and
assigns the name as the instance’s identifier.

Some examples of this could be:

-   The name of a react component
-   The name of your new express app and name in package json
-   etc, etc

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance of a template name `node-server` and we
have the build path of `my-food-app` then Templates will create a new directory
called `my-food-app` and render all the templates contents inside of it

```text
// highlight-start
| - my-food-app/
    | - <node-server contents...>
// highlight-end
```

</Example>

### Long build path

A long build path is a build path that contains a `location` and `name`.

```text
// highlight-next-line
projects/my-food-app
|______| |_________|
^ location    ^ instance name
|___________________|
       ^ build path
```

Templates still follows all the rules of a single build path. However, the
directory thats created based on the `name` is created inside the `location`
directory. If the `location` directory doesnt exist it will be created. In case
above, `my-food-app` instance will be created in the `projects` directory.

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance of a template named `node-server` and we
have the build path `code/projects/my-food-app` then Templates will create a new
directory called `my-food-app` inside of `<cwd>/code/projects` and render all
the templates contents inside.

```text title="Rendered instance"
|- code
    |- projects
        // highlight-start
        | - my-food-app/
            | - <node-server contents...>
        // highlight-end
```

</Example>

### Multiple build paths

Multiple build paths are a way to create multiple instances of a template in a
single process. When defining multiple build paths, you can use a mix of short
and long builds paths:

```text
projects/my-food-app projects/my-gas-app my-food-app-2
|__________________| |_________________| |____________|
    ^ build path 1        ^ build path 2      ^ build path 3
```

Templates generates an instance for every build path. Each instance is
independant and follows the same process as if you were just generating the
single instance. Generating multiple instances may not be ideal for every
template, but it&apos;s especially useful for templates that create sections or
pieces of an existing app—such as new React components, API routes, background
job files, and more.

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance of a template named `node-server` and we
have the build paths `projects/my-food-app` & `projects/my-gas-app` then
emplates will create both instances in the `projects` directory.

```text title="Rendered instance"
|- projects
    // highlight-start
    | - my-food-app/
        | - <node-server contents...>
    | - my-gas-app/
        | - <node-server contents...>
    // highlight-end
```

</Example>

### No Build path

Some template's dont need a build path to generate a new instance. This is
because they dont need a new folder or any unique instance name to generate your
content. However, you will only be able to generate this instance in the
directory you are located in. Some examples of this can be a eslint
configuration file, jest configuration file, or anything in this similar vain.

:::caution

Always refer to the template's documention page to see how they want you to use
their template

:::

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance of a template named `eslint` and we didnt
specific a build path, it could create something like the following:

```text title="Rendered instance"
|- <cwd>
    // highlight-start
    | - <eslint contents...>
    // highlight-end
```

</Example>

:::note

Templates allow you to provide a build path to a template that doesn&apos;t
require one. Currently, Templates have no way of determining whether a build
path is required for a given template. However, this behavior may change in
future versions. Always refer to the template&apos;s documentation for the
recommended usage

## How to generate a new instance

Our CLI is our primary way to generate new instances of a template. You can
access the CLI after [installation](./intro#installation) with the `tps`
command:

```bash
tps <template-name> [build-paths...]
```

Replace `<template-name>` with the name of the template you want to use and add
any build paths afterward.

```bash
# Short build path
tps my-template buildPath1

# Long build path
tps my-template path/to/dir/buildPath1

# Multiple build paths
tps my-template buildPath1 path/to/dir/buildPath2

# No build path
tps my-template
```

:::tip

Use the [list command](../api/cli#list) to see what templates are available.

```bash
tps list
```

:::

<Example>

If you wanted to use our [`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx)
template you would replace `<template-name>` with `react-component` and then the
component you want to create afterwards (E.g.
[build path](#what-is-a-build-path)). For this demo, well be creating a `Nav`
component:

```bash
tps react-component Nav
```

This will then generate something similar to the follow:

```text
| - <cwd>
    | - Nav/
        | - <react-component contents...>
```

You can use a [long build path](#long-build-path) if you want to place this
instance in a sub directory.

Example, its common for some components like a nav to live in a
`src/components/` directory so using the same
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx) template and component
`Nav`, you can use the following to generate the `Nav` instance in
`src/components/`:

```bash
tps react-component src/components/Nav
```

If you want to generate multiple instances at the same time you can use
something similar to the following:

```bash
tps react-component src/components/Nav src/components/Footer
```

</Example>

## Using a Template's Options

Template's can define options to make their template more dynamic. Templates
allows you to use these options in 4 main ways:

-   Interactive
-   CLI
-   Config file
-   Aliases

Hidden options are a special type of option that we will cover in the
[hidden options section](#hidden-options).

### Interactive

The primary method of answering options is through interactive prompts. When you
generate a new instance of a template, Templates will prompt you in the terminal
all non hidden options then generate your instance.

```bash
tps react-component Nav
? Would you like to use typescript (y/N)
```

If you press `Enter` without typing anything, Templates will use the option's
default value as the answer. You can also cancel the process by sending an
interrupt signal (E.g `ctrl + c`).

### CLI

Templates supports using options directly on the command line, allowing you to
quickly provide answers without going through all the prompts interactively. The
command-line flag for each option corresponds to its name, prefixed with `--`.
For example, if an option is named `hey`, the corresponding CLI flag would be
`--hey`. **When you provide an answer using a CLI flag, Templates will skip
prompting for that option.**

```bash
tps some-template instance1 --optionName [value]
```

We recommend adding all options after your build path(s) in order to prevent
needing a CLI separator `--`.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="recommended" label="Recommended">

```bash
tps my-template app --option1 value1 --option2 value2 value3
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="not-recommended" label="Not Recommended">

```bash
tps my-template --option1 value1 --option2 value2 value3 -- app
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Example>

To use the `extension` option from
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx), you can add a
`--extension` flag to the CLI command:

```bash
tps express-app my-app --extension jsx
```

</Example>

Now lets go over how to answer different types of prompts:

###### Boolean

When dealing with options that accept boolean values, specify the option name on
the CLI without any value. To use a `true` value, simply use the option name as
shown below:

```bash
--typescript
```

To use a `false` value, add the `no-` prefix in front of the option name:

```bash
--no-typescript
```

<Example>

To use the `typescript` option from
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx), you can do the following:

```bash
tps react-component Nav --typescript
```

If you don't want to use `typescript`, then you can do the following:

```bash
tps react-component Nav --no-typescript
```

</Example>

###### Single values

When dealing with options that accept a single value, specify the option name
and value afterwards:

```bash
--cssType less

# or a number

--age 23

# or with =

--type=something

# if your value has spaces, wrap it with quotes

--message "hey there everyone"
```

<Example>

To use the `cssExtension` option from
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx), you can do the following:

```bash
tps express-app app --cssExtension react
```

</Example>

###### List

When dealing with options that accept a list of values, specify the option name
and all values afterwards:

```bash
--ages 23 45 65

# or strings

--numbers ten nine five "forty five"
```

<Example>

To use the `extras` option from a template named `my-template`, you can do the
following:

```bash
tps my-template app --extras metrics unit e2e
```

</Example>

### Configuration file

Templates also support answering options in our
[configuration file](./tpsrc.mdx). When adding an answer to our config file,
Templates will use this answer when generating a new instance, and you will no
longer be prompted for the option.

To answer a template's option, you need to first specify the template name. Then
you can add your answer to the `answers` object, which takes a key/value pair of
optionName/optionAnswer.

```json title=".tpsrc"
{
    "<template-name>": {
        "answers": {
            "<option-name>": "<option-answer>"
        }
    }
}
```

You can read more about how to use our configuration file in our
[configuration guide](./tpsrc.mdx).

<Example>

To use the `typescript` option from
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx), you can add `true` for the
`typescript` option in your config file like the following:

```json title=".tpsrc"
{
    "react-component": {
        "answers": {
            "typescript": true
        }
    }
}
```

Afterward, you will no longer be prompted if you want to use TypeScript, and
your React components will always be generated in TypeScript.

</Example>

### Aliases

Some Templates option's have aliases that you can use to answer the option. You
can find these in the `aliases` column for your template's options. You can use
these aliases just like any normal option name. The only exeption is single
charater aliases which can be used on the CLI with only one `-` and then the
single charater.

```bash
tps my-template app -t
```

<Example>

To use the `typescript` option alias, `t`, from
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx), you can do the following:

```bash
tps react-component Nav -t
```

If you dont want to use `typescript`, then you can do the following:

```bash
tps react-component Nav --no-typescript
```

</Example>

### Hidden Options

Hidden options are options that don't get prompted by default. These options
usually allow for more fine modifications that are too cumbersome to ask every
time. You can answer hidden options just like normal prompts (e.g., CLI, config
file) with the exception of being asked interactively. In order to have hidden
options get prompted, you can use the `hidden` option on the command line when
generating a new instance.

```bash
tps my-template app --hidden
```

## Core Options

Below will show you how to use some of Template's core options. You can find a
full list of these options in the [Templates API docs](./../api/template.mdx).
All core options can be specified on the CLI or in our
[config file](./tpsrc.mdx).

To use core options on the CLI, use the option name as a flag similar to how you
would with [template's options](#cli).

```bash
tps my-template app --optionName optionValue
```

To use core options in our [config file](./tpsrc.mdx), add them to the `opts`
object for the template you want the options to have effect on.

```json title=".tps/tpsrc"
{
    "my-template": {
        "opts": {
            "optionName": "optionValue"
        }
    }
}
```

:::caution

Defining options in our [config file](./tpsrc.mdx) is only allowed at the
template level. We don't support defining options that affect all templates.
However, this may change in the future.

:::

### Default

By default, Templates will prompt you for every non-hidden option that does not
have a defined value. To skip all these interactive prompts, you can use the
`default` option which will have Templates use default values for each option.

```bash
tps my-template app --default
```

You can use this in conjunction with options on the CLI and in your
[config file](./tpsrc.mdx):

```bash
tps my-template app --default --option1 value1 --option2
```

### Wipe

By default, Templates will throw an error if the directory it needs to create is
already created or if any of the files it needs to create are already created.
To force the creation of this instance, you can use the `wipe` option. The
`wipe` option will delete any directories or files that Templates need to create
first, then render your instance.

```bash
tps my-template app --wipe
```

This is very useful when you want to render a new instance of an instance you
just created but with different options.

<Example>

Let's say you have the following directory structure:

```text
| - app
    | - .tps/
        | - ...
    | - src/
        // highlight-start
        | - Home/
            | - ...
        // highlight-end
```

If you were trying to render a new instance of the `react-component` template
and called this `Home`, tps would error out because a `Home` directory already
exists. However, if you add the `--wipe` flag, tps will delete this directory
first, then render your new instance in its place.

```bash
tps react-component src/Home --wipe
```

This will produce:

```text
| - app
    | - .tps/
        | - ...
    | - src/
        // highlight-start
        | - Home/
            | - <react-component template files ...>
        // highlight-end
```

</Example>

### Force

Very similar to the [`wipe`](#wipe) command, the `force` option will force the
creation of any files that already exist. The main difference between these
commands is that `wipe` deletes folders and files while `force` only overrides
any files that have conflicts.

```bash
tps my-template app --force
```

This is useful when you created an instance and added additional files and
folders in your instance but you want to regenerate the instance with different
options without losing your additional work.

<Example>

Let's say you have the following directory structure:

```text
| - app
    | - .tps/
        | - ...
    | - src/
        // highlight-start
        | - Home/
            | - some-file.js
        // highlight-end
```

If you were trying to render a new instance of the `react-component` template
and called this `Home`, tps would error out because a `Home` directory already
exists. However, if you add the `--force` flag, tps will force the creation of
your instance but will only overwrite conflicting files.

```bash
tps react-component src/Home --force
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="no-conflict" label="No conflicts">

If the `react-component` template doesn't create a `some-file.js`, then the
original file will be left in place and not touched.

```text
| - app
    | - .tps/
        | - ...
    | - src/
        | - Home/
            // highlight-next-line
            | - some-file.js
            | - <react-component template files ...>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="conflict" label="Conflicting file">

If the `react-component` template was going to render a `some-file.js`, then the
file will be overridden by the template's `some-file.js`.

```text
| - app
    | - .tps/
        | - ...
    | - src/
        | - Home/
            // highlight-next-line
            | - some-file.js <--- from react-component
            | - <react-component template files ...>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</Example>

### Extending Directory

Templates `extendDest` option allows you to extend each build path with a
additional path. This additional path is added to the front of your build path
and can be used in conjunction with a [long build path](#long-build-path).

| Build Path(s) | extendDest | Result                 |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| app           | myPath/    | myPath/app             |
| subPath/app   | myPath/    | myPath/subPath/app     |
| app app2      | myPath/    | myPath/app myPath/app2 |

This option is very useful when you know your instances will be generated in a
paticular directory every time and you dont want to type this out every time.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="config" label="Config File">

        You can add the `extendDest` to the `opts` object in your config file to always append a
        path to every instance you create.

        ```txt title=".tps/tpsrc"
        {
            "my-template": {
                "opts": {
                    "extendDest": "path/to/directory",
                }
            }
        }
        ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI Option">

        Sorry, not supported yet! Coming soon...

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>
