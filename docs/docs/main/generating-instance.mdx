# Generating an Instance

Generating an instance of a template involves creating a new entity based on the
contents of your template. During this process, templates will take the files
and folders defined in the template and render them to your build path(s).

## What is a Build Path

The build path is a combination of an name and an optional location that you
provide to templates. Templates uses this build path to determine where to
render your instance file and folders.

The `name` represents the instance identifer. Templates will create a new
directory based off the name supplied and generate all templates contents into
that directory.

The `location` tell templates where to put this new instance. This is useful if
you dont want your instance generated in the directory your in.

The build path resembles a linux file path pattern and there are 4 main
variations you can utilize:

-   Short build path
-   Long build path
-   Multiple build paths
-   No build path

### Short build path

A short build path is a build path that only contains a `name`.

```text
// highlight-next-line
my-food-app
|__________|
 ^ Build path and instance name
```

Like mentioned before, templates creates a new directory with this `name` and
renders the tenmplates contents into the directory. Templates also assigns this
`name` as the instances `name`. This `name` can also be used internally by the
template in places that require a name.

Some examples of this could be:

-   The name of a react component
-   The name of your new express app and name in package json
-   etc, etc

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance of a template name `node-server` and we
have the build path of `my-food-app` then templates will create a new directory
called `my-food-app` and render all the templates contents inside of it

```text
// highlight-start
| - my-food-app/
    | - <node-server contents...>
// highlight-end
```

</Example>

### Long build path

A long build path is a build path that contains a `location` and `name`.

```text
// highlight-next-line
projects/my-food-app
|______| |_________|
^ location    ^ instance name
|___________________|
       ^ build path
```

Templates still follows all the rules of a single build path. However the
directory thats created based on the `name` is created inside the `location`. In
case above, `my-food-app` instance will be created in the `projects` directory.

:::note

If the `location` is not a valid directory, then directory will be created in
this process

:::

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance of a template named `node-server` and we
have the build path `code/projects/my-food-app` then templates will create a new
directory called `my-food-app` inside of `<cwd>/code/projects` and render all
the templates contents inside.

```text title="Rendered instance"
|- code
    |- projects
        // highlight-start
        | - my-food-app/
            | - <node-server contents...>
        // highlight-end
```

</Example>

### Multiple build paths

Multiple build paths are a way to create multiple instances of a template in a
single process. When defining multile build paths you can use a mix of short and
long builds paths:

```text
projects/my-food-app projects/my-gas-app my-food-app-2
|__________________| |_________________| |____________|
    ^ build path 1        ^ build path 2      ^ build path 3
```

Templates will generate instances for all build paths and each instance's build
path will follow the same rules as if you were just generating a single
instance. While generating multiple instances may not make sense for every
single template, this is very powerful when using a template that generates a
subset of your application like a react component, Api route, background job
file, etc.

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance of a template named `node-server` and we
have the build paths `projects/my-food-app` & `projects/my-gas-app` then
templates will create both instances in the `projects` directory.

```text title="Rendered instance"
|- projects
    // highlight-start
    | - my-food-app/
        | - <node-server contents...>
    | - my-gas-app/
        | - <node-server contents...>
    // highlight-end
```

</Example>

### No Build path

Some template's dont need a build path to generate a new instance. This is
because they dont need a new folder or any unique instance name to generate your
content. Some examples of this can be a template that creates a eslint
configuration file, jest configuration file, or anything in this similar vain.

:::caution

Always refer to the template's documention page to see how they want you to use
their template

:::

<Example>

If we were generating a new instance of a template named `eslint` and we didnt
specific a build path, it could create something like the following:

```text title="Rendered instance"
|- <cwd>
    // highlight-start
    | - <eslint contents...>
    // highlight-end
```

</Example>

:::note

Templates will still allow you to provide a build path to a template that
doesn't require one. Templates will still follow the rules of a build path and
place all templates contents into it.

If a build path is not supplied to a template that requires one, you will have
unexpected result's. Templates has no knowledge of whether or not a template
requires a build path and will not error out. This may change in future versions
of templates. Always refer to the template's documention recommended way to use
the template.

## How to generate a new instance

Our CLI is our primary way to generate new instances of a template. You can
access the CLI after [installation](./intro#installation) with the `tps`
command:

```bash
tps <template-name> [build-paths...]
```

Replace `<template-name>` with the name of the template you want to use and add
any build paths afterward.

```bash
# Short build path
tps my-template instance1

# Long build path
tps my-template path/to/dir/instance1

# Multiple build paths
tps my-template instance1 path/to/dir/instance2

# No build path
tps my-template
```

:::tip

Use the [list command](../api/cli#list) to see what templates are available.

```bash
tps list
```

:::

<Example>

If you wanted to use our [`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx)
template you would replace `<template-name>` with `react-component` and then the
component you want to create afterwards (E.g.
[build path](#what-is-a-build-path)). For this demo, well be creating a `Nav`
component:

```bash
tps react-component Nav
```

This will then generate something similar to the follow:

```text
| - <cwd>
    | - Nav/
        | - <react-component contents...>
```

You can use a [long build path](#long-build-path) if you want to place this
instance in a sub directory.

Example, its common for some components like a nav to live in a
`src/components/` directory so using the same
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx) template and component
`Nav`, you can use the following to generate the `Nav` instance in
`src/components/`:

```bash
tps react-component src/components/Nav
```

If you want to generate multiple instances at the same time you can use
something similar to the following:

```bash
tps react-component src/components/Nav src/components/Footer
```

</Example>

## Using a Template's Options

Templates can define options to make their template more dynamic. Templates
allows you to use these options in 3 main ways:

-   Interactive
-   CLI
-   Config file
-   Aliases

Hidden options are a special type of option that we will cover in the
[hidden options section](#hidden-options).

### Interactive

The primary method of answering options is through interactive prompts. When you
generate a new instance of a template, Templates will prompt you in the terminal
all non hidden options then generate your instance.

```bash
tps react-component Nav
? Would you like to use typescript (y/N)
```

If you press enter without typing anything, Templates will use the default value
of the option as the answer.

{/* ctrl + c */}

### CLI

Templates also supports using options on the command line. This allows you to
quickly answer the option without having to go through all the prompts
interactively.

The name of the option will correspond directly to the option name.

:::note

When answering prompt on command line, you will no longer get prompted this
option

:::

```bash
tps some-template instance1 --optionName [value]
```

We recommend adding all options after your build path(s) in order to prevent
needing a CLI separator `--`.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="recommended" label="Recommended">

```bash
tps my-template app --option1 value1 --option2 value2 value3
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="not-recommended" label="Not Recommended">

```bash
tps my-template --option1 value1 --option2 value2 value3 -- app
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Example>

To use the `extension` option from
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx), you can add a
`--extension` flag to the CLI command:

```bash
tps express-app my-app --extension jsx
```

</Example>

Now lets go over how to answer different types of prompts:

###### Boolean

When dealing with options that accept boolean answers, you will specify the
option name on the cli without any value. To use a `true` value, just use the
option name like the following:

```bash
--typescript
```

To use a `false` value, add a `no-` prefix in front of the option name:

```bash
--no-typescript
```

<Example>

To use the `typescript` option from
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx), you can do the following:

```bash
tps react-component Nav --typescript
```

If you dont want to use `typescript`, then you can do the following:

```bash
tps react-component Nav --no-typescript
```

</Example>

###### Single values

When dealing with options that accept a single value, you will specify the
option name and value afterwards

```bash
--cssType less

# or a number

--age 23

# or with =

--type=something

# if your value has spaces then you need wrap it with quotes

--message "hey there everyone"
```

<Example>

To use the `cssExtension` option from
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx), you can do the following:

```bash
tps express-app app --cssExtension react
```

</Example>

###### List

When dealing with options that accept a list of values, you will specify the
option name and all values afterwards

```bash
--ages 23 45 65

# or strings

--numbers ten nine five "forty five"
```

<Example>

To use the `extras` option from a template named `my-template`, you can do the
following:

```bash
tps my-template app --extras metrics unit e2e
```

</Example>

### Configuration file

Templates also supports answering prompts in our
[configuration file](./tpsrc.mdx). When adding an answer to our config file,
Templates will use this answer when generating a new instance and you will no
longer be prompted for the option.

To answer a templates option, you need to first specific the template name. Then
you can add your answer to the `answers` object which takes a key/value pair of
optionName/optionAnswer.

```json title=".tpsrc"
{
    // highlight-start
    "<template-name>": {
        "answers": {
            "<option-name>": "<option-answer>"
        }
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

You can read more about how to use our configuration file in our
[configuration guide](./tpsrc.mdx)

<Example>

To use the `typescript` option from
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx), You can add `true` for the
`typescript` option in your config file like the following:

```json title=".tpsrc"
{
    "react-component": {
        "answers": {
            // highlight-next-line
            "typescript": true
        }
    }
}
```

After, you will no longer be prompted if you want to use typescript and your
react components will always be generated in typescript.

</Example>

### Aliases

Some Templates option's have aliases that you can use to answer the option. You
can find these in the `aliases` column for your template's options. You can use
these aliases just like any normal option name. The only exeption is single
charater aliases which can be used on the CLI with only one `-` and then the
single charater.

```bash
tps my-template app -t
```

<Example>

To use the `typescript` option alias, `t`, from
[`react-component`](./templates/react-component.mdx), you can do the following:

```bash
tps react-component Nav -t
```

If you dont want to use `typescript`, then you can do the following:

```bash
tps react-component Nav --no-typescript
```

</Example>

### Hidden Options

Hidden options are options that dont get prompted by default. These options
usually allow for more fine modifications that are to combersome to ask every
time. You can answer hidden options just like normal prompts (E.g. CLI, config
file) with the excpetion of being asked interactively. In order to have hidden
options get prompted, you can use the `hidden` option on the command line when
generating a new instance.

```bash
tps my-template app --hidden
```

## Core Options

Below will show you how to use some of Template's core options. You can find a
full list of these options in the [Templates API docs](./../api/template.mdx).
All core options can be specified on the CLI or in our
[config file](./tpsrc.mdx).

To use core options on the CLI, use the option name as a flag similar to how you
would with [template's options](#cli).

```bash
tps my-template app --optionName optionValue
```

To use core options in our [config file](./tpsrc.mdx), Add them to the `opts`
object for the template you want the options to have effect on.

```txt title=".tps/tpsrc"
{
    "my-template": {
        "opts": {
            "optionName": "optionValue",
        }
    }
}
```

:::caution

Defining options in our [config file](./tpsrc.mdx) are only allowed at the
template level. We dont support defining options that effect all templates.
However this may change in the future.

:::

### Default

By default, Templates will prompt you every non hidden option that does not have
a defined value. To skip all these interactive prompts, you can use the
`default` option which will have Templates use default values for each option.

```bash
tps my-template app --default
```

you can use this in conjunction with options on the CLI and in your
[config file](./tpsrc.mdx)

```bash
tps my-template app --default --option1 value1 --option2
```

### Wipe

By default, Templates will throw an error if the directory it needs to create is
already created or if any of the files it needs to create is already created. In
order to force the creation of this instance, you can use the `wipe` option. The
`wipe` option will delete any directories or files that Templates needs to
created first then render your instance.

```bash
tps my-template app --wipe
```

This is very useful when you want to render a new instance of a instance you
just created but with different options or etc.

<Example>

Lets say you have the following directory structure

```text
| - app
    | - .tps/
        | - ...
    | - src/
        // highlight-start
        | - Home/
            | - ...
        // highlight-end
```

If I was trying to rendering a new instance of `react-component` template and
called this `Home`, tps would error out because a `Home` directory already
exists. However if you add the `--wipe` flag, tps will delete this directory
first, then render your new instance in its place.

```bash
tps react-component src/Home --wipe
```

Will produce:

```text
| - app
    | - .tps/
        | - ...
    | - src/
        // highlight-start
        | - Home/
            | - <react-component template files ...>
        // highlight-end
```

</Example>

### Force

Very similar to the [`wipe`](#wipe) command, the `force` option will force the
creation of any files that already exist. The main difference between these
commands are `wipe` deletes folders and files while `force` only overrides any
files that have conflicts.

```bash
tps my-template app --force
```

This is useful when you created an instance and added additional files and
folder in your instance but you want to regenerate the instance with different
options without your additional work.

<Example>

Lets say you have the following directory structure

```text
| - app
    | - .tps/
        | - ...
    | - src/
        // highlight-start
        | - Home/
            | - some-file.js
        // highlight-end
```

If I was trying to rendering a new instance of `react-component` template and
called this `Home`, tps would error out because a `Home` directory already
exists. However if you add the `--force` flag, tps will force the creation of
your instance but will only overwrite conflicting files.

```bash
tps react-component src/Home --force
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="no-conflict" label="No conflicts">

If the `react-component` template doesnt create a `some-file.js` then the
original file will be left in place and not touched.

```text
| - app
    | - .tps/
        | - ...
    | - src/
        | - Home/
            // highlight-next-line
            | - some-file.js
            | - <react-component template files ...>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="conflict" label="Conflicting file">

If the `react-component` template was going to render a `some-file.js`, then the
file will be overridden by the templates `some-file.js`.

```text
| - app
    | - .tps/
        | - ...
    | - src/
        | - Home/
            // highlight-next-line
            | - some-file.js <--- from react-component
            | - <react-component template files ...>
```

Notice how `some-files.js` was not delete

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</Example>

### Extending Directory

Templates `extendDest` option allows you to extend each build path with a
additional path. This additional path is added to the front of your build path
and can be used in conjunction with a [long build path](#long-build-path).

| Build Path(s) | extendDest | Result                 |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| app           | myPath/    | myPath/app             |
| subPath/app   | myPath/    | myPath/subPath/app     |
| app app2      | myPath/    | myPath/app myPath/app2 |

This option is very useful when you know your instances will be generated in a
paticular directory every time and you dont want to type this out every time

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="config" label="Config File">

        You can add the `extendDest` to the `opts` object in your config file to always append a
        path to every instance you create.

        ```txt title=".tps/tpsrc"
        {
            "my-template": {
                "opts": {
                    "extendDest": "path/to/directory",
                }
            }
        }
        ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI Option">

        Sorry, not supported yet! Coming soon...

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>
