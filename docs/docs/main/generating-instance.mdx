# Generating an Instance

Generating an instance of a template involves creating a new entity based on the
contents of your template. During this process, templates will take the files
and folders defined in your template and render them to your build path(s).

### Build paths

The build path is the information you provide to TPS to specify the location and
details of the new template to be created. It can be thought of as the name or
identifier for the new instance. When TPS receives the build path, it creates a
directory with that name and renders all the files and folders from your
template packages into this newly created directory. In essence, the build path
acts as a directive to TPS, guiding it in assembling the new template by
organizing the appropriate files and folders in the designated directory.
