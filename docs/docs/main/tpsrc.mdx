# Configure Templates

## Initializing Repo with Templates

Before delving into custom components or configuring template behavior, the
initial step is to Initialize your repository with templates. This
straightforward process will generate a .tps folder containing a .tpsrc file,
located within your current working directory.

```bash
tps init
```

Produces:

```text
| - <cwd>
	// highlight-start
	| - .tps/
		| - .tpsrc
	// highlight-end
```

The `.tps` folder also serves as the designated location for your custom
templates. For further insights into creating custom templates, refer to our
detailed documentation on [creating a new template](./create-new-template/).

Furthermore, keep on reading these docs to gain in-depth knowledge about the
`.tpsrc` file.

## Configuring a Template

Tps offers a json configuration file that caters specifically to users of your
template, as opposed to the [settings file](./create-new-template/settings)
which is intended for template development. The configuration file is named
`.tpsrc` and it allows you to define predefined configurations for each
template, altering tps behavior during rendering. With the ability to have
multiple template configurations within this file, users gain greater control
and flexibility when utilizing your template. This file needs to be in a `.tps`
folder in the root of your repo.

```json title=".tpsrc"
{
    // highlight-next-line
    "<template-name>": {}
}
```

When adding configurations for template replace the `<template-name>` to be the
name of your template. This property will hold all configurations for that
template.

<Example>

Say we had a template named `react-component`. Now to add configurations to this
template I would put the following inside of my tpsrc file

```json title=".tpsrc"
{
    // highlight-start
    "react-component": {
        /* react-component template specific configs */
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

</Example>

Like mentioned before, you can add multiple template configurations

```json title=".tpsrc"
{
    // highlight-start
    "<template-name-1>": {},
    "<template-name-2>": {}
    // highlight-end
}
```

<Example>

Say we had two templates `react-component` and `express-app-route` and wanted to
also add configurations then the tpsrc files would look something like this:

```json title=".tpsrc"
{
    // highlight-start
    "react-component": {
        /* react-component template specific configs */
    },
    "express-app-route": {
        /* express-app-route template specific configs */
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

</Example>

check out the [tpsrc API](../api/tpsrc)

### Answering Templates Prompts

You have the option to define pre-existing answers for specific template prompts
by using the `answers` property. This feature prevents the prompt from being
displayed every time you render a new template. When rendering, the system will
first read all the answers from this file and only prompt the user for the ones
that remain unanswered. This functionality proves to be beneficial when you want
a template to behave in a particular manner within a specific directory.

```json title=".tpsrc"
{
    "<template-name>": {
        // highlight-start
        "answers": {
            "<prompt-name>": "<prompt-answer>"
        }
        // highlight-end
    }
}
```

<Example>

If I had a template named `hello-world` and a prompt named `age`:

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "prompts": [
        {
            // highlight-next-line
            "name": "age"
            // ...
        }
    ]
}
```

The I can set the answer to the prompt in our `.tpsrc` file with

```json title=".tpsrc"
{
    "hello-world": {
        "answers": {
            // highlight-next-line
            "age": 23
        }
    }
}
```

</Example>

### Configuring Templates

Additionally, you can define pre-existing options that modify the behavior of
templates consistently for a given template. This provides a convenient way for
users to have templates function in a desired manner each time they use them
within the repository. You can configure templates behavior with the `opts`
property

```json title=".tpsrc"
{
    "<template-name>": {
        // highlight-start
        "opts": {
            "<opt-name>": "<opt-answer>"
        }
        // highlight-end
    }
}
```

:::note

To find all the available options for configuring templates, check out the
[Template Options API](../api/template#options)

:::

<Example>

If I had a template named `react-component` and I wanted to always force the
creation of my new instance even if one already exists then I can add a `force`
option to my templates configuration.

```json title=".tpsrc"
{
    "react-component": {
        "opts": {
            // highlight-next-line
            "force": true
        }
    }
}
```

This would be equivilent to passing a `--force` flag to the create command

```bash
tps react-component Nav --force
```

</Example>

## Make a Global Configuration File

Templates also allows you to have global settings. In order to initialize global
settings or templates run the following command

```bash
tps init --global
```

This will create a `.tps` and `.tpsrc` folder in your home directory.

:::note

Note sure what a home directory is? Check out this
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory)

For mac uses your home directory is usually refered to as `~` on the command
line
