# Templates

Have you ever came across repeating yourself creating certain files over and over again? How about files that look almost similar but with a couple of words different? Ever wish you had `create-react-app` but for all different types of languages/tools/frameworks?

That's where `templates` come into play. Templates is a easy to use filesystem generator aimed to speed up developer workflows, prescribing best practices, and/or spinning up new projects.

This is what Templates is here to solve. Save endless hours of waisted time and speed up your developer workflow by creating a `template` and using this template to generate new files and folders in your new projects.
