Templates is a powerful filesystem generator that aims to simplify the process of getting started with and maintaining code applications. Its purpose is to provide developers with a friendly tool that streamlines their common day-to-day workflows. The versatility of templates extends to various scenarios, such as creating web applications in any programming language or generating new sections within a project, such as web controllers with unit tests or React components integrated with Redux and TypeScript.
