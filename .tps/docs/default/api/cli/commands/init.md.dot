## Init

### Description

initialize your repo as a tps repo. This will allow you to set tps template settings and build templates for your repo. All this command does is create a `.tps/` folder with `.tpsrc` file inside it in your `cwd`.

by default, tps will throw an error if you try to initialize a child directory when a parent directory is already initialized. If you would like to do this anyways use the `force` flag.

<!-- Templates allows you to keep all configurations/settings inside a `.tpsrc` file. Use the `init` command in any repo to initialize it as a templates repo. -->

> Note: You should initialize the settings in your repos root directory.
