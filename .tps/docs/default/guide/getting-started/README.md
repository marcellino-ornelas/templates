# Getting started

## Intro

Templates is a filesystem generator aimed at making it easier to getting started and/or maintaining code applications. Templates purpose is to give developers a friendly tool that helps does there common day to day workflows. Now templates can be used for variety of workflows like:

- Creating a web application in any language.
- Creating new sections in your project, like a new web controller with unit tests or a react component with redux or typescript or both
- Creating docs. _(fun fact: these docs are written with templates)_
- Easy way to

## The Problem

Have you ever started on a new project. Have you ever been working on a project and found that you create similar folders over and over. Or have you e

Yeoman is a generic scaffolding system allowing the creation of any kind of app. It allows for rapidly getting started on new projects and streamlines the maintenance of existing projects.

Yeoman is language agnostic. It can generate projects in any language (Web, Java, Python, C#, etc.)

Yeoman by itself doesn’t make any decisions. Every decision is made by generators which are basically plugins in the Yeoman environment. There’s a lot of publicly available generators and its easy to create a new one to match any workflow. Yeoman is always the right choice for your scaffolding needs.

Here are some common use cases:

Rapidly create a new project
Create new sections of a project, like a new controller with unit tests
Create modules or packages
Bootstrapping new services
Enforcing standards, best practices and style guides
Promote new projects by letting users get started with a sample app
Etc, etc

Templates is

What is tps? What is Templating? Were glad you asked! Tps is a dynamic template generator.

Wow that sounds confusing right? Don't worry we got you.

Coping and pasting is in every developers work flow. It saves countless time rather than re-inventing the wheel every time. But theres one down side, you can only copy and paste the code.

How about when you need to copy a folder structure? or copy code from two or more files?

This is where tps comes in. Tps allows you to create a `template` which is a folder filled with files and folders and code, images, or whatever you want and allows you to reuse the folder structure where ever you want! Think of tps as a more powerful way to copy files for re-usability.

Have you ever built a express app before? or react component? If so, you know when you create these items theres a lot of similar files, code, and a certain folder structure that you will use every single time (for the most part). Do you really want to build this every time you have to make a express app? Hell no, with the power of tps you easily create a template and have express apps created in seconds!!!!

> Note: tps uses a templating engine to compile and render the files. More documentation on how to use the templating engine can be found [here](http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html)

> Note: All features of doT may not be supported. If you wish to use a feature and it doesn't work feel free to make a issue on Github.

> Note: all examples in this guide will generate templates with [use](../api/cli/commands/use.md)
