# Templating

## Description

Building dynamic template is the purpose of TPS.

> Note: create-components-react uses a templating engine to compile and render the files. More documentation on how to use the templating engine can be found [here](http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html)

> Note: All features of doT may not be supported. If you wish to use a feature and it doesn't work feel free to make a issue on Github.

> Note: all examples in this guide will generate templates with [use](../cli/commands/use.md)
