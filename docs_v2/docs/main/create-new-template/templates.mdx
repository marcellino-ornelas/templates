# Templates

:::info
We will be referring to `<some-name>` in our guide to represent any directory.
:::

A tps template is a collection of folders and files that acts as a blueprint for effortlessly recreating identical file structures in different locations.
Think of it as a convenient "copy and paste" functionality. When rendering a tps template, the tool scans all the files and
directories within the template folder, and proceeds to duplicate them in a directory of your preference.

tps goes beyond simple duplication by enabling you to incorporate additional information during the template rendering process, resulting in a more dynamic template. The concept of dynamic customization will be further discussed in detail later in this guide

## Where do templates live

All TPS templates need to live in a `.tps` folder. Sub directories of the `.tps` folder are referred to are your `templates`. You may have as many templates as you wish.

```text
| - .tps/
	// highlight-next-line
    | - <template...>/
```

<Example>
If I were to make a new template called <code>react-component</code> then my folder structure would look like this:

```text
| - .tps/
	| - react-component/
```

</Example>

## Packages

Now lets break down what to put in your template folder. Inside of each `template` you can have directories referred to as `packages`.

```text
| - .tps/
	| - <template>/
		// highlight-next-line
		| - <packages...>/
```

Now, within each package directory, you have the freedom to add an unlimited number of files and directories.
These resources will be utilized during the template rendering process. You are free to name the
packages as you wish, with one exception. While each template can have a `default` package, it is not mandatory to specify one.

Every time you render a template, tps will
automatically utilize all the contents _(files/directories)_ within your `default` package.
For any additional packages contents that you wish to include in the rendering process, you must
explicitly specify them when rendering the template.

Dont worry more will be covered on this in our [packages guide](./packages)

<Example open>

Lets say we have a template called `node-server`. This template is
responsible for setting up a brand new webserver with all the bells and whistles included.

```text
| - .tps/
	| - node-server/
		| - default/
			// highlight-start
			| - server.js
			| - package.json
			// highlight-end
```

lets say today we had a new idea for a trash removal company called `trash-removal`.
If we wanted to generate this app with our template then it would create a new directory called `trash-removal`
and render all files inside the templates `default` package and place them into the new `trash-removal` directory it just created

```text
| - trash-removal/
	// highlight-start
	| - server.js
	| - package.json
	// highlight-end
```

</Example>

:::note
You can learn more about packages in our [packages guide](./packages.md)
:::

## Settings file

```text
| - .tps/
	| - <template>/
		// highlight-next-line
		| - settings.json
```

A template can optionally have a settings file where you can define prompts and other configuration details.
The settings file will be discussed in more detail later in this guide.

:::note
You can learn more about the settings file in our [settings file guide](./settings/README.md)
:::

## Dynamic files

Within each package, you have the ability to use dynamic files. A file is considered
dynamic when it has a `.dot` extension. These files enable you to leverage all the features provided by [doT](http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html) within tps.

Dynamic files provide the capability to pass data and enhance the power of dynamic rendering.
By utilizing this data, you can leverage the features of doT to conditionally render specific sections of
code or perform other dynamic operations. This allows for more flexibility and customization in your templates.

## Making a new template

There is nothing special about a template. Its nothing other than a directory holding a collection of files and folders. We could create a template two ways:

1. Use our command line tool _(recommended)_
2. Create the directories and files with `mkdir/touch` or use Finder etc.

## Rendering a new template

### what is rendering a template

Rendering a new template, also known as template instantiation or the template instantiation process, refers
to the action of utilizing a template as a starting point to create a new instance. It involves duplicating
the files and folders from the template folder and transferring them to a different location, effectively
replicating a "copy and paste" action.

```
+ - - - - - - - +    + - - - - - - - - - +    + - - - - - - - - - - +    + - - - - - - - - - - - - -+
| Tps gets path |    | loads all files & |    | creates a new       |    | creates each file &      |
| to template   | -> | folders for each  | -> | directory from the  | -> | folder from the packages |
+ - - - - - - - +    | package passed in |    | locations passed in |    | in each new directory    |
					 + - - - - - - - - - +    + - - - - - - - - - - +    + - - - - - - - - - - - - -+
```

The "location" that you pass in to tell tps where to render the new template to are referred to as a `build path`. You can kind of think of the build path as the name of the new template being created. tps will get this build path and create a directory with that name and copy all of the files & folders from your templates packages into that new directory.

The build path could can either be a single word or a file system like path like so:

```
app
|__|
	^ Build path
```

or with a path

```
some/path/app
|____________|
	^ Build path
```

Now when the build path is just a single word then the build path is also the name of the new template being created. This name is used to create the name of the new directory. If I passed in `app` as the build path then a directory app will be created and all of the templates files & folders will be placed into `app`.

```
| - app/
	| - <all-of-the-template-files...>
```

But when the build path has a long path attached, only the end word is the name of the template.

```
some/path/app
		 |___|
			^ name of template
```

The rest of the path is used as an additional location when rendering the template. So if you passed in `some/path/app` then `app` will be created in the `some/path` directory. If the directory doesn't exist it will be created.

```
| - some/
	| - path/
		| - app/
			| - <all-of-the-template-files...>
```

You can also pass in multiple build paths at the same time. This is going to be the same as passing in one but for each one.

### How to render a template

There are two ways on how to render a template. One is via our command line tool or by our `node_module` package. We wont go deep into this topic right now but here are some basics.

`<template-to-use>` is the name of the template you would like to use.

:::tip
Not sure what templates you have? Check out our [list command](../../api/cli/list.md)
:::

`<build-paths...>` is the location/name of where you want your new rendered template to go

<Tabs groupId="cli-node">
  <TabItem value="tps" label="tps cli" default>

```bash
# create command

tps create --use=<template-to-use> <build-paths...>

# or use command

tps <template-to-use> <build-paths...>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="node" label="Node">

```js
const Templates = require('tps');

const tps = new Templates('<template-to-use>');
// ^ In js pass in the name to the template here

const buildPaths = ['<build-paths...>'];
// ^ In js build paths should always be an array

tps.render('<some-directory-path>', buildPaths);
// ^ In js we need to add a path to some directory so tps has a
// starting directory. tps cli tools uses this node module
// underneath the hood and uses the terminals current working
// directory as the `<some-directory-path>` path
```

## Example

Lets create our first template together. For this example we will be creating a template that generates a `index.js` file for us that, if ran it will print out "hello world". Easy right? Lets do this...

First change your cwd into our `tps-example` folder.

```bash
cd path/to/tps-example
```

Next create a template called `hello-world`.

```bash
tps new template hello-world
```

This will create a `hello-world` directory inside of the `tps-example/.tps` directory. Inside of that directory, will be a `default` folder.

```
| - tps-example/
	| - .tps/
		| - hello-world/
			| - default
```

Next add a `index.js` file into `tps-example/.tps/hello-world/default`.

```bash
echo "console.log('hello world')" > .tps/hello-world/default/index.js
```

Our `tps-example` should now resemble this folder structure

```
| - tps-example/
	| - .tps/
		| - hello-world/
			| - default
				| - index.js
```

Now to create this template call this command.

```bash
tps hello-world firstTemplate
```

This should create a folder called `firstTemplate` inside of `tps-example` like so:

```text
| - tps-example/
	| - .tps/
		| - ...
	// highlight-start
	| - firstTemplate/ <-- template you just created
		| - index.js
	// highlight-end
```

Now if we:

```bash
cat firstTemplate/index.js
```

well get.

```js
console.log('hello world');
```
