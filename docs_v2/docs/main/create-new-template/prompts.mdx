# Prompting

## What is a prompt

```bash
❯ tps react-component Nav
? Would you like to include unit tests? (true)
```

Prompting is a useful feature that allows you to obtain data from the user. By
displaying a message on the command line, we can request a response from the
user. Additionally, prompts can be answered by providing a flag via the command
line or through the node module package, which is particularly helpful when
users already know their desired input. The options for prompts can vary in
various formats.

In our system, we utilize the
[inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/tree/v6.0.0) library for
prompting. This enables you to use any property available in inquirer when
creating prompts. For more information on the available properties in inquirer,
you can refer to the documentation
[here](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/tree/v6.0.0).

## How to make a Prompt

To add prompts to your template, simply add a `prompts` property to your
settings file, which should be an array consisting of the prompts you wish to
present to the user. Each prompt will be represented as an object, with varying
properties depending on the type of prompt.

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    /* prompts ... */
  ]
}
```

:::tip

Don't remember what the setting file is? Refresh your memory in the
[settings files guide](./settings)

:::

Now lets go over some of the basics. To get a full list of properties check out
the [prompts API documentations](/docs/api/settings#prompts)

### Name

Let's start with the `name` field. This field is essential for enabling
prompting functionality. All of your prompt answers will be conveniently stored
under the [`tps.answers`](/docs/api/template-context#answers) object property.

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      "name": "<some-name>"
      // ...
    }
  ]
}
```

The name you provide to the prompt will be used in order to access the users
answer.

```js
{{= tps.answers["<name-of-prompt>"]}}
```

<Example>

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      "name": "age"
      // ...
    }
  ]
}
```

you can access the answer with:

```text
{{= tps.answers.age }}
```

</Example>

---

### Message

The second property is `message`. This property will tell inquirer what to ask
the user when they are rendering a new instance.

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      "message": "<some-message>"
      // ...
    }
  ]
}
```

<Example>

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "unit",
      // highlight-next-line
      "message": "Would you like to include unit tests?"
    }
  ]
}
```

When the user renders a new instance they will see the message added in your
prompt

```bash
❯ tps react-component Nav
# highlight-next-line
? Would you like to include unit tests?
```

</Example>

---

### Type

The next property is `type`. This property will tell inquirer what type of
prompting you would like to use. You can see more about this property in the
[inquirer question docs](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/tree/v6.0.0#question).

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      "type": "confirm | input | checkbox | list | rawlist | password"
      // ...
    }
  ]
}
```

<Example>

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "over18",
      // highlight-next-line
      "type": "confirm",
      "message": "Are you over the age of 18?"
    }
  ]
}
```

Produces

```bash
❯ tps react-component Nav
? Are you over the age of 18?
```

</Example>

---

### Tps Type

The next field is `tpsType`. This field tells tps how it should process the
users answer. There are two options `package` or `data`.

:::note

If you don't specify a `tpsType` field. Tps will use `package` by default.

:::

#### package

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      "tpsType": "package"
      // ...
    }
  ]
}
```

When you have `package` as the `tpsType`, tps will try to use the users value to
render a package that is in your template. Different values passed in will have
different behaviors.

##### boolean

In the case where a prompt's answer is a boolean and its value is `true`, Tps
will utilize the **name** of the prompt to search for a package with the same
name. If such a package is found, tps will include it during the rendering
process of the new instance. When the value is `false`, tps will disregard the
prompt and do nothing.

:::important

Prompts of type `confirm` will return their answers as booleans.

:::

<Example>

Say were rendering a new `express-app` instance and we have a prompt like so

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "unit",
      "tpsType": "package",
      "type": "confirm",
      "message": "Do you want to include unit tests?"
    }
  ]
}
```

since this is declared as a package type, this needs a corresponding package in
the template

```text
| - .tps/
	| - express-app/
		| settings.json
		| - default/
			| - server.js
		// highlight-next-line
		| - unit/        <-- matches name of prompt
			| - server.test.js
```

When the user is rendering a new template, the prompt will be displayed and they
can answer.

```bash
❯ tps express-app newApp
? Would you like to include unit tests?
```

Depending on what the user answers depends on what will happen:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yes" label="User answers yes">

If user answers `yes`, then the `unit` package will be included in the rendering
process so a `server.test.js` will be added

```text
| - newApp/
	| - server.js
	// highlight-next-line
	| - server.test.js
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="no"  label="User answers no">

If user answers `no`, then the `unit` package will not be include in the
rendering process so no `server.test.js`.

```text
| - newApp/
	| - server.js
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</Example>

###### string

When a prompt's answer is a string, word or name, tps will take that answer and
attempt to find a package that corresponds to it. If one is found then tps will
include it in the rendering process.

:::important

Prompts of type `list` and `input` will return their answers as strings.

:::

<Example>

Say were rendering a new `express-app` instance and we have a prompt like so

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "framework",
      "tpsType": "package",
      "message": "What type of frontend framework would you like to use?",
      // highlight-start
      "type": "list", // <--- makes prompt accept strings
      "choices": ["react", "angular"]
      // highlight-end
    }
  ]
}
```

since this is declared as a package type, the choices to the question must match
a package in our template.

```text
| - .tps/
	| - express-app/
		| settings.json
		| - default/
			| - server.js
		// highlight-start
		| - react/
			| - react.js
		| - angular/
			| - angular.js
		// highlight-end
```

When the user is rendering a new instance, the prompt will be displayed and the
user can answer.

```bash
❯ tps express-app newApp
? What type of framework would you like to use?
> react
  angular
```

With the choice the user selects, tps will then include a package that matches
the answer

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="react" label="User answers react">

If user answers `react`, then the `react` package will be included in the
rendering process so a `react.js` will be added

```text
| - newApp/
	| - server.js
	// highlight-next-line
	| - react.js
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="angular"  label="User answers angular">

If user answers `angular`, then the `angular` package will be included in the
rendering process so a `angular.js` will be added

```text
| - newApp/
	| - server.js
	// highlight-next-line
	| - angular.js
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</Example>

###### list

If a prompt's answer consists of a list of strings, tps will consider each
individual answer and locate the corresponding packages associated with them.
These packages will then be included during the rendering process.

:::important

Prompts of type `checkbox` will return their answer as list of strings.

:::

<Example>

Say were rendering a new `express-app` instance and we have a prompt like so

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "extras",
      "message": "Would you like to include any other features?",
      "tpsType": "package",
      // highlight-start
      "type": "checkbox", // <--- makes prompt accept list of strings
      "choices": ["metrics", "unit", "e2e", "api"]
      // highlight-end
    }
  ]
}
```

since this is declared as a package type, the choices to the question must match
a package in our template.

```text
| - .tps/
	| - express-app/
		| settings.json
		| - default/
			| - server.js
		// highlight-start
		| - metrics/
			| - metrics.js
		| - unit/
			| - server.test.js
		| - e2e/
			| - website.test.js
		| - api/
			| - api.js
		// highlight-end
```

When the user renders a new template. tps will ask for an list of inputs.
Whatever the user answers, tps will take all of the values and try to find a
packages that matches the answers.

If the user answers `metrics` and `unit` then both packages will be included in
the rendering process

```text
| - newApp/
	// highlight-next-line
	| - metrics.js
	// highlight-next-line
	| - server.test.js
	| - server.js
```

</Example>

#### data

```json
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      "tpsType": "data"
      // ...
    }
  ]
}
```

When the `tpsType` is set to `data`, tps will leave the data untouched. This
data type is designed to allow you to retrieve additional information from the
user, which you can then process according to your specific needs. One common
use case for this is to conditionally render specific code within the file based
on the user's response to a certain question. Any inquirer [type](#type) can be
used.

<Example>

Say were rendering a new `express-app` instance and we have a prompt like so

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "security",
      "message": "Would you like to include common express security packages?",
      "tpsType": "data",
      // highlight-start
      "type": "confirm" // <--- makes prompt accept boolean
      // highlight-end
    }
  ]
}
```

When the user is rendering a new instance, the prompt will be displayed and the
user can answer. Whatever the user answers will now be available for use in your
dynamic files.

<Dot lang="js" tps={{ answers: {security: true}}}>

```text
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

/* node code ... */

{{? tps.answers.security }}app.use(helmet());{{?}}

/* node code ... */
```

</Dot>
</Example>

## How to answer prompts

### Interactive

The primary method of answering prompts is through interactive prompts. When you
generate a new instance of a template, tps will prompt the user to provide
answers until all the prompts are completed. This interactive mode is also the
default way to respond to prompts.

### Flags

Tps also supports answering prompt questions through command line flags. This
feature enables users to obtain their desired results directly without having to
go through all the prompts interactively. The flag's name will correspond to the
prompt's name specified in your settings file.

```bash
tps some-template app --some-flag <some-value>
```

<Example>

If we were rendering a new instance using the `express-app` template and had
this settings file

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      "name": "unit",
      "message": "Would you like to include unit tests?",
      "tpsType": "package",
      "type": "confirm"
    }
  ]
}
```

The user can answer this prompts questions by adding a `unit` command line flag

```bash
tps express-app app --unit
```

</Example>

Now lets go over how to answer different types of prompts

###### boolean

When dealing with boolean values, such as those from a confirm prompt, you have
the option to answer the prompt using a flag with the same name as the prompt.
To answer with `true`, simply use:

```bash
--unit
```

On the other hand, if you want to provide a `false` value, add `no-` before the
flag name:

```bash
--no-unit
```

<Example>

If we were rendering a new instance using the `express-app` template and had
this settings file

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      "name": "unit",
      "message": "Would you like to include unit tests?",
      "tpsType": "package",
      "type": "confirm"
    }
  ]
}
```

The user can answer this prompts questions by adding a `unit` command line flag

```bash
tps express-app app --unit
```

</Example>

###### string

When dealing with string values, such as those from a input or list prompts, add
the value right after your flag

```bash
--cssType less

# or if you need a number

--age 23

# if your value has spaces then you need to do this

--message "hey there everyone"
```

<Example>

If we were rendering a new instance using the `express-app` template and had
this settings file

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      // highlight-next-line
      "name": "framework",
      "message": "What frontend package would you like to include",
      "tpsType": "package",
      "type": "list",
      "choices": ["react", "angular", "vue"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The user can answer this prompts questions by adding a `framework` command line
flag and adding the value after the flag named

```bash
tps express-app app --framework react
```

</Example>

###### list

If the value type is an list then you end up with something like this.

```bash
--ages 23 45 65

# or strings

--numbers ten nine five
```

<Example>

If we were rendering a new instance using the `express-app` template and had
this settings file

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "extras",
      "message": "Would you like to include any other features?",
      "tpsType": "package",
      "type": "checkbox", // <--- makes prompt accept list of strings
      "choices": ["metrics", "unit", "e2e", "api"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The user can answer this prompts questions by adding a `extras` flag and putting
the values after the flag name

```bash
tps express-app app --extras metrics unit e2e
```

</Example>

:::note

Using list types can be difficult when using multiple flags etc. yargs is used
for its command line parser. You can refer how to pass in list of arguments
[here](http://yargs.js.org/docs/#api-reference-arraykey)

When using lists on the command line it is recommended to add the flag after all
required fields:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bad" label="Bad">

when using lists on the command line before all required params, you have to add
a extra `--` after the list flag so yargs can parse the require params correctly

```bash
tps express-app --extras metrics api unit -- app
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="good" label="Good">

Move the list param to the end of the command in order to prevent this extra
adition

```bash
tps express-app app --extras metrics api unit

# Addition flags

tps express-app app --extras metrics api unit --some-other-flag
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

### node

To answer prompts in javascript using the module. Use the `setAnswers` function.

```js
const Templates = require('tps');

const tps = new Templates('react-component');

/**
 * Just like the command line passing in data supports strings, numbers, and arrays
 * @example string
 *  const data = '23';
 * @example number
 *  const data = 23;
 * @example boolean
 *  const data = true;
 * @example array
 *  const data = [23, 45, 65];
 */
const age = 23;

tps.setAnswers({ age });
```

### Aliases

Aliases are commonly used for command line flags, providing convenient shortcuts
for better interaction. To enhance usability, tps enables you to assign aliases
to your prompts. These aliases can be utilized to answer prompts either through
the command line or via the node module, offering flexible options for prompt
handling.

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "framework",
      /* ... */
      "aliases": ["<alias-name>"]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Example>

If we were rendering a new instance using the `express-app` template and had
this settings file

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "framework",
      "choices": ["react", "vue", "angular"],
      /* ... */
      "aliases": ["f"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Now we can answer the prompt question via the alias

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="command-line" label="Command line">

```bash
tps express-app app -f react
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="node" label="Node">

```js
const Templates = require('tps');

const tps = new Templates('express-app');

tps.setAnswers({ f: 'react' });
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</Example>

---

## Inquirer

Like mentioned before, Tps uses inquirer for prompting. This mean we can use any
of inquirer properties also. Here are some examples:

### booleans Example

Say you have this react component template:

```text
| - tps-example
	| - .tps/
		| - react-component/
			| - settings.json
			| - default/
				| - index.js
			| - css
				| - {{=tps.name}}.css
```

Adding this prompt will allow you to conditionally render the css package

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "css",
      "type": "confirm",
      "message": "Would you like to add a css file?"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now if the user answers true like so:

```bash
tps react-component App --css
```

then this will be the new template:

```text
    | - tps-example
        | - .tps/
            | - ...
        | - App
           | - index.js
           | - App.css
```

Now if the user answers false like so:

```bash
tps react-component App --no-css
```

then this will be the new template:

```text
    | - tps-example
        | - .tps/
            | - ...
        | - App
           | - index.js
```

### Lists Examples

```json title="settings.json"
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "modules",
      "type": "checkbox",
      "choices": ["react", "express", "fs", "path"],
      "tpsType": "data",
      "message": "What node modules would you like to import into this js file?"
    }
  ]
}
```
