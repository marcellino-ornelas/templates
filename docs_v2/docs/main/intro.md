# Welcome to Templates

:::info
Templates is commonly referred as `tps`. Any mentions to `tps` is referring to the whole library and not individual templates you can create. Dont worry we will go over this later
:::

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g templates-mo
```

<!-- Templates is a filesystem generator aimed at making it easier to getting started and/or maintaining code applications. Templates purpose is to give developers a friendly tool that helps them do their common day to day workflows. Now templates can be used for variety of workflows like:

- Creating a web application in any language.
- Creating new sections in your project, like a new web controller with unit tests or a react component with redux or typescript or both

The possibilities are endless with templates.

You can sort of think of templates as a function but for your filesystem. When your coding you can easily copy and paste code all over the place but that would be messy and unmaintainable right? Instead you can put all your logic/code into a function so its defined in one spot but can be used over and over again with different arguments. Thats nice for code but what about when you create a new react component in your web application, or a new controller for your api? Well you'll probably start off by manually creating a file, opening up a similar file to copy and paste the parts you need because chances are your not gonna remember how to build it from scratch right away or without looking it up. What about if you need to do this for 2? 3? files for one piece of your app to work? or add some unit tests? Wouldn't it be nice just to press a button, plug some info in then BAM! you now have a working component or controller ready plug in and use? This is where templates comes into play! -->
<!--
### Why

Have you ever found yourself creating the same files repeatedly? Or maybe you come across files that are almost the same, but with a few different words. Wouldn't it be great if there was a tool like create-react-app, but for all kinds of programming languages, tools, and frameworks?

That's where templates come in. Templates are an easy-to-use tool that helps you speed up your work as a developer. They let you generate file structures quickly, follow best practices, and start new projects with ease. Templates are here to solve the problem of wasting hours doing repetitive tasks. By creating a template and using it to generate files and folders in your projects, you can save a lot of time and make your developer workflow faster and more efficient." -->
